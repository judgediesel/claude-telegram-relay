Not every business needs a $500,000 loan. Sometimes, what stands between you and a successful business is $5,000 for inventory, $15,000 for equipment, or $30,000 for working capital to get through the next quarter.

But here's the problem: most banks don't want to deal with small loans. The overhead cost of underwriting a $10,000 loan is nearly the same as a $500,000 loan, so banks focus on the bigger deals. That leaves millions of small business owners — especially startups, sole proprietors, and entrepreneurs in underserved communities — without access to the capital they need.

That's where microloans come in.

**Microloans are small business loans — typically under $50,000** — offered by nonprofit organizations, Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), and government-backed programs specifically designed to fill the gap that traditional banks leave behind. They're easier to qualify for, more flexible with credit requirements, and often come with free business mentoring and support.

In this guide, we'll cover every major microloan program available in 2026, what they cost, who qualifies, and exactly how to apply.

## What Are Microloans?

A microloan is a **small-dollar loan designed for entrepreneurs and small businesses** that can't access traditional bank financing. The concept originated in developing countries (Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus pioneered modern microfinance in Bangladesh in the 1970s), but it's now a major part of the U.S. small business funding landscape.

**Key characteristics of microloans:**

- **Loan amounts:** Typically $500 to $50,000 (average is around $13,000)
- **Interest rates:** 8-18% (varies by lender and borrower profile)
- **Repayment terms:** 6 months to 7 years
- **Collateral requirements:** Often flexible — many don't require traditional collateral
- **Credit requirements:** More lenient than banks — some programs accept scores below 600
- **Extra support:** Many microlenders provide business training, mentoring, and technical assistance along with the loan

### How Microloans Differ from Traditional Business Loans

| Feature | Microloans | Traditional Bank Loans |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| Loan amount | $500 - $50,000 | $50,000 - $5,000,000+ |
| Minimum credit score | 575-650 (varies) | 680+ |
| Collateral required | Often minimal or none | Usually required |
| Time in business | Startups welcome | Typically 2+ years |
| Approval time | 1-4 weeks | 30-90 days |
| Business mentoring included | Often yes | Rarely |
| Lender type | Nonprofits, CDFIs | Banks, credit unions |
| Application complexity | Moderate | High |

## Top Microloan Programs in 2026

### 1. SBA Microloan Program

The SBA Microloan Program is the **largest government-backed microloan program** in the country. The SBA provides funds to nonprofit intermediary lenders, who then lend directly to small businesses.

**Program details:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Maximum loan amount | $50,000 |
| Average loan amount | ~$13,000 |
| Interest rates | 8-13% (set by intermediary) |
| Repayment terms | Up to 6 years (maximum) |
| Collateral | Varies by intermediary — personal guarantee often required |
| Use of funds | Working capital, inventory, supplies, equipment, furniture/fixtures |
| Cannot be used for | Real estate purchases, paying off existing debt |

**Who qualifies:**
- For-profit small businesses in the U.S.
- Nonprofits (certain childcare centers)
- Startups and new businesses are eligible
- No minimum credit score set by the SBA, but intermediaries have their own requirements (typically 620+)
- Must demonstrate ability to repay

**How to apply:**
1. Find an SBA-approved intermediary lender in your area at [sba.gov/local-assistance](https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance)
2. Contact the intermediary directly — they each have their own application process
3. Most intermediaries also offer free business training and technical assistance

**What makes it stand out:** The SBA Microloan Program is one of the few government-backed lending programs where **startups with no revenue history can qualify**. Many intermediaries also provide business mentoring as part of the loan package.

**There are approximately 130 SBA-approved intermediary lenders** across the country. Some of the most well-known include:

- Accion Opportunity Fund (national)
- Grameen America (national)
- LiftFund (Southern U.S.)
- Pacific Community Ventures (West Coast)
- WESST (New Mexico and surrounding areas)

### 2. Kiva — 0% Interest Crowdfunded Microloans

**Kiva is unlike any other microloan program.** It's a crowdfunding platform where individual lenders — regular people from around the world — contribute $25 or more toward your loan. The loan is **0% interest, with no fees**.

**Program details:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Maximum loan amount | $15,000 |
| Interest rate | 0% |
| Fees | None |
| Repayment terms | Up to 36 months |
| Collateral | None |
| Credit check | No hard credit check |

**How it works:**
1. Create a profile and loan request on [kiva.org/borrow](https://www.kiva.org/borrow)
2. First, invite your personal network (friends, family, customers) to lend — you need to raise a portion from your network to prove social backing
3. Once you hit your initial threshold, your loan goes public on Kiva's platform
4. Individual lenders worldwide contribute $25+ until your loan is fully funded
5. Repay over 6-36 months with no interest and no fees

**Who qualifies:**
- U.S.-based businesses and entrepreneurs
- Must be 18+ and a U.S. resident
- No minimum credit score
- Startups and pre-revenue businesses are welcome
- Must have a verifiable social network (for the initial fundraising phase)

**What makes it stand out:** It's hard to beat 0% interest. Kiva is especially powerful for businesses that have a compelling story and an active community of supporters. The crowdfunding model also serves as a form of market validation — if people are willing to fund your loan, it's a signal that your business resonates.

**Limitations:** The $15,000 maximum is relatively low, and the fundraising process takes time (typically 2-4 weeks). You also need to be comfortable sharing your business story publicly on the platform.

### 3. Accion Opportunity Fund

Accion Opportunity Fund (formerly Accion and Opportunity Fund, which merged in 2021) is one of the **largest nonprofit small business lenders in the U.S.**, serving entrepreneurs nationwide.

**Program details:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Loan amounts | $5,000 - $250,000 |
| Interest rates | Starting at ~7% (varies by borrower) |
| Repayment terms | 12-60 months |
| Collateral | Not always required |
| Minimum credit score | 580+ |
| Time in business | 12+ months preferred (startups considered case by case) |

**What they fund:**
- Working capital
- Equipment
- Inventory
- Marketing
- Hiring
- Expansion

**What makes it stand out:** Accion specifically focuses on **underserved entrepreneurs** — immigrants, women, people of color, and low-to-moderate income business owners. They also provide free business coaching, workshops, and financial education alongside their loans.

**How to apply:** Apply online at [accionopportunityfund.org](https://www.accionopportunityfund.org) or call their lending team.

### 4. Grameen America

Inspired by the original Grameen Bank founded by Muhammad Yunus, **Grameen America provides microloans exclusively to women entrepreneurs** living below the poverty line.

**Program details:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Initial loan amount | $500 - $2,000 |
| Subsequent loans | Up to $15,000+ (increases with successful repayment) |
| Interest rate | ~15% APR |
| Repayment terms | 6 months (with weekly payments) |
| Collateral | None |
| Credit check | None — they don't check credit scores |

**How it works:**
1. Join or form a 5-member lending group in your community
2. Attend financial training sessions (typically 5 days)
3. Open a savings account with Grameen America
4. Receive your first loan ($500-$2,000)
5. Make weekly repayments and savings deposits at group meetings
6. Upon successful repayment, qualify for larger subsequent loans

**Who qualifies:**
- Women living below the federal poverty line
- Must live in a city where Grameen America operates (currently in 24 cities including New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Charlotte, Miami, and others)
- Must be willing to participate in group meetings and financial training

**What makes it stand out:** Grameen America has disbursed over **$4 billion in microloans** to more than 150,000 women since 2008. The group lending model creates accountability and community — borrowers support each other. They also report payments to credit bureaus, helping members build credit history.

### 5. CDFIs (Community Development Financial Institutions)

CDFIs are **specialized financial institutions whose primary mission is to serve low-income and disadvantaged communities**. There are over 1,400 certified CDFIs in the U.S., and many of them offer microloans.

**General CDFI microloan terms:**

| Feature | Typical Range |
|---------|--------------|
| Loan amounts | $500 - $100,000 |
| Interest rates | 7-18% |
| Repayment terms | 1-7 years |
| Collateral | Flexible — often minimal |
| Credit requirements | Flexible — many work with challenged credit |

**What makes CDFIs unique:**
- **Mission-driven:** They exist to help communities, not maximize profit
- **Flexible underwriting:** They consider your whole story, not just your credit score
- **Wrap-around support:** Many offer business training, financial coaching, and networking
- **Local knowledge:** They understand the specific challenges of their communities

**How to find a CDFI near you:**

## How to Apply for a Microloan: Step by Step

The exact process varies by lender, but here's the general pathway:

### Step 1: Assess Your Needs

Before you apply anywhere, get clear on:
- **How much money do you need?** (Be specific — don't borrow more than necessary)
- **What exactly will you use it for?** (Lenders want a detailed plan)
- **How will you repay it?** (Show projected revenue or income)
- **What's your timeline?** (Some programs take 2-4 weeks; others take 2-3 months)

### Step 2: Research Available Programs

Use the resources listed above to identify 2-3 programs that match your needs, location, and eligibility profile. Consider reaching out to your local SBDC or SCORE chapter — they can help you navigate the options.

### Step 3: Prepare Your Application Materials

While requirements vary, most microlenders will want:

**Essential documents:**
- Personal identification (government-issued ID)
- Business description and plan (doesn't need to be 50 pages — a clear 2-5 page plan works)
- Financial projections or current financial statements
- Personal financial information
- Bank statements (3-6 months)
- Tax returns (personal and business, if applicable)

**For startups:**
- A solid business plan is even more important since you don't have financial history
- Proof of relevant experience or training
- Description of your target market and how you'll reach customers
- Detailed use of funds plan

### Step 4: Apply

- **Online applications:** Kiva, Accion, and many CDFIs accept online applications
- **In-person applications:** Some SBA intermediaries and community organizations prefer face-to-face meetings
- **Phone applications:** Some lenders will walk you through the process over the phone

**Pro tip:** If you're applying to a program that includes business training (like Grameen America or many SBA intermediaries), plan to attend the training sessions — they're often required before loan disbursement, and the knowledge genuinely helps.

### Step 5: Complete Any Required Training

Many microloan programs require borrowers to complete business training before receiving funds. This might include:
- Financial literacy workshops
- Business planning sessions
- Marketing fundamentals
- Bookkeeping basics
- Group meetings (Grameen America model)

This isn't busywork — studies show that borrowers who receive training alongside funding have significantly higher business survival rates.

### Step 6: Receive Funds and Begin Repayment

Once approved, funds are typically deposited directly into your business bank account. Repayment schedules vary:
- **Weekly payments** (Grameen America)
- **Monthly payments** (most SBA microloans, CDFIs, Accion)
- **Monthly payments** (Kiva — you set the schedule within their terms)

## What to Do if You're Denied

Getting turned down for a microloan isn't the end of the road. Here's your action plan:

### Ask Why

Every lender should be able to tell you why they denied your application. Common reasons include:
- Insufficient cash flow or revenue projections
- Credit issues (too low, too recent negative marks)
- Incomplete application
- Business plan lacks detail
- Industry considered too risky

### Fix the Issue

- **Credit problems?** Work on improving your score for 3-6 months. Our [credit improvement guide](/improve-credit-score-fast) walks through the fastest strategies.
- **Weak business plan?** Visit SCORE (score.org) for free mentoring — a mentor can help you strengthen your plan.
- **Cash flow concerns?** Start generating revenue (even small amounts) before reapplying. Any proof of income strengthens your case.

### Try a Different Lender

Microlenders have different criteria. A rejection from one doesn't mean you'll be rejected by all. If an SBA intermediary says no, try a CDFI. If a CDFI says no, try Kiva (which has no credit check). Cast a wider net.

### Start Smaller

If $25,000 was denied, try $10,000. Or start with a $5,000 Kiva loan, build a track record of successful repayment, and then apply for a larger loan. Each successful repayment builds your borrowing credibility.

## Using Your Microloan Wisely

Getting the loan is just the beginning. Here's how to make it count:

### Do

- **Use funds exactly as planned** — Lenders may ask for documentation
- **Track every dollar** — Keep detailed records of how you spend the money
- **Make payments on time, every time** — Late payments damage your credit and your relationship with the lender
- **Build an emergency fund** — Set aside 10% of your revenue so you're not dependent on another loan
- **Take advantage of mentoring** — If your lender offers it, use it. Free business advice is invaluable.

### Don't

- **Don't use loan funds for personal expenses** — This is a business loan
- **Don't borrow more than you need** — Interest adds up
- **Don't skip payments without communicating** — If you're struggling, call your lender. Many offer hardship options.
- **Don't ignore the training component** — Microloans paired with education produce the best outcomes

## Microloans vs. Other Funding Options

How do microloans stack up against other ways to fund a small business?

| Funding Source | Amount | Cost | Speed | Credit Needed | Best For |
|---------------|--------|------|-------|---------------|----------|
| Microloans | $500-$50K | 8-18% APR | 1-8 weeks | Low-Medium | Startups, small needs |
| SBA 7(a) Loans | Up to $5M | 10-13% APR | 30-90 days | 680+ | Established businesses |
| Business Credit Cards | $5K-$50K | 15-25% APR | Instant | 670+ | Short-term needs |
| Online Lenders (Kabbage, OnDeck) | $5K-$500K | 20-80% APR | 1-3 days | 600+ | Emergency funding |
| Small Business Grants | $500-$50K+ | Free | 2-6 months | None | Those who qualify |
| Friends & Family | Varies | Negotiable | Immediate | None | Close relationships |
| Crowdfunding | $1K-$1M+ | Platform fees (5-10%) | 30-60 days | None | Consumer products |
| Personal Savings | Varies | None | Immediate | None | Everyone (ideal) |

**Key takeaway:** Microloans fill a critical gap between "can't get a bank loan" and "don't have personal savings." They're more affordable than online lenders, more accessible than SBA 7(a) loans, and don't require giving up equity like investment capital.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the minimum credit score for a microloan?

It depends on the program. SBA microloans through intermediaries typically require a score of **620 or higher**, though some are flexible. Accion Opportunity Fund works with scores as low as **580**. Kiva and Grameen America don't check credit scores at all. CDFIs vary widely but generally have the most flexible credit requirements.

### Can I get a microloan for a startup with no revenue?

Yes. Startups are one of the primary groups that microloans are designed to serve. **Kiva, Grameen America, and many SBA microloan intermediaries** actively lend to pre-revenue businesses. You'll need a solid business plan and a clear explanation of how you'll generate revenue and repay the loan.

### How fast can I get a microloan?

It varies significantly. **Kiva** takes 2-4 weeks for the crowdfunding process. **Accion** can fund in as little as **1-2 weeks**. **SBA microloans** typically take **2-6 weeks**. **Grameen America** requires completing training first, which takes about **5 weeks** before the first loan disbursement.

### Do microloans build business credit?

Many microlenders **report to credit bureaus**, which means on-time payments build your credit history. This is one of the hidden benefits of microloans — a successful microloan can help you qualify for larger loans in the future. Ask your lender whether they report to personal and/or business credit bureaus before you apply.

### Can I use a microloan to pay off debt?

Generally, **no**. Most microloan programs (including SBA microloans) prohibit using funds to pay off existing debt. The funds must be used for business operations — working capital, inventory, equipment, or other growth-related expenses. If debt consolidation is your goal, an SBA 7(a) loan or a CDFI term loan may be better options.

### What happens if I can't repay my microloan?

If you're struggling to make payments, **contact your lender immediately**. Many microlenders offer hardship options like deferred payments, modified repayment schedules, or temporary interest-only payments. Defaulting on a microloan will damage your personal credit (since most require a personal guarantee) and may result in collections activity. Communication is key — lenders want to help you succeed, not chase you for payments.

### Are microloans tax deductible?

The **interest you pay on a business microloan is tax deductible** as a business expense. The principal amount of the loan is not deductible (because it's not income — it's borrowed money). Consult a tax professional for specific guidance based on your situation.

---

## Final Thoughts

Microloans exist because the traditional financial system wasn't designed for small entrepreneurs. Banks want big deals with minimal risk. But the backbone of the American economy is built on small businesses — the food truck, the Etsy shop, the freelance graphic designer, the neighborhood landscaping company. These businesses need capital too, even if it's "only" $5,000 or $20,000.

If you need a relatively small amount of money to start, sustain, or grow your business, a microloan may be exactly what you need. The terms are fair, the requirements are reachable, and many programs wrap in the education and mentoring that help you use the money wisely.

Start with the programs listed in this guide. Reach out to 2-3 lenders. Ask questions. Attend the free training. And don't be discouraged if the first answer is no — there are more microloan options than most people realize, and the right fit is out there.

Every big business was once a small one. The capital to grow yours might be closer than you think.
