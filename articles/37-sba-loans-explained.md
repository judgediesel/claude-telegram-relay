Getting a business loan can feel like running into a wall — especially if you're a startup, you don't have perfect credit, or you lack the collateral that traditional banks demand. That's exactly why the Small Business Administration exists.

SBA loans aren't handed out by the government directly. Instead, the SBA **guarantees a portion of the loan**, which reduces the risk for lenders. That guarantee means banks and credit unions are willing to approve borrowers they'd otherwise turn down — with better rates and longer repayment terms than conventional loans.

In 2026, the SBA backs over **$28 billion in small business loans annually** through its network of approved lenders. Whether you need $5,000 to buy equipment or $5 million to expand your operations, there's likely an SBA loan program that fits.

This guide breaks down every SBA loan type, who qualifies, what the process looks like, and how to dramatically improve your chances of getting approved.

## How SBA Loans Work

Before diving into specific programs, let's clarify what SBA loans actually are — because there's a common misconception.

**The SBA does not lend money directly to businesses.** Instead, it works like this:

1. You apply for a loan through an **SBA-approved lender** (bank, credit union, or online lender)
2. The lender underwrites and funds the loan
3. The SBA **guarantees 50-85%** of the loan amount
4. If you default, the SBA repays the guaranteed portion to the lender

**Why this matters to you:** Because the lender's risk is reduced, they're willing to:
- Approve borrowers with **lower credit scores** (typically 650+, sometimes lower)
- Offer **longer repayment terms** (10-25 years vs. 3-5 for conventional loans)
- Charge **lower interest rates** (capped by the SBA)
- Accept **less collateral** than conventional loans require

**The trade-off:** SBA loans involve more paperwork and take longer to process than conventional loans — usually 30-90 days from application to funding.

## Types of SBA Loans

The SBA offers several loan programs, each designed for different needs. Here's a complete breakdown.

### SBA 7(a) Loan — The Most Popular Option

The 7(a) loan program is the SBA's **flagship program** and the most flexible option for small businesses. It accounts for roughly 60% of all SBA lending.

**Loan details:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Maximum loan amount | $5,000,000 |
| SBA guarantee | Up to 85% (loans up to $150,000) or 75% (loans over $150,000) |
| Interest rates | Prime rate + 2.25% to 4.75% (variable) |
| Repayment terms | Up to 10 years (working capital); up to 25 years (real estate) |
| Down payment | Typically 10-20% |
| Fees | Guarantee fee of 0-3.75% based on loan amount |

**What you can use it for:**
- Working capital and operating expenses
- Purchasing equipment, furniture, or fixtures
- Buying inventory
- Refinancing existing business debt
- Purchasing real estate
- Acquiring an existing business
- Starting a new business

**Who qualifies:**
- For-profit business operating in the U.S.
- Meets the SBA's size standards (varies by industry — generally under 500 employees for manufacturing, under $8 million in revenue for most services)
- Owner has invested their own time or money into the business
- Demonstrated ability to repay the loan
- Cannot get comparable credit elsewhere on reasonable terms

**Best for:** Established businesses that need flexible funding for almost any legitimate business purpose.

### SBA 7(a) Small Loans

A subset of the 7(a) program for smaller amounts.

**Loan details:**
- Maximum: **$350,000**
- Streamlined application process
- Faster approval times
- Same rates and terms as standard 7(a)

**Best for:** Businesses that need moderate funding without the full 7(a) application burden.

### SBA Express Loans

The fastest SBA loan option, designed for businesses that need money quickly.

**Loan details:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Maximum loan amount | $500,000 |
| SBA guarantee | 50% (lower than standard 7(a)) |
| Turnaround time | 36 hours for SBA response |
| Interest rates | Prime + up to 4.5% (loans up to $50,000) or Prime + up to 6.5% (over $50,000) |
| Repayment terms | Up to 10 years (25 years for real estate) |

**What makes it different:** The SBA responds to the lender's request within **36 hours** — much faster than the standard 7(a) process. The trade-off is a lower guarantee percentage (50% vs. 75-85%), which means the lender takes on more risk and may have slightly stricter requirements.

**Best for:** Businesses that need funding quickly and have a solid relationship with their bank.

### SBA 504 Loan — For Real Estate and Major Equipment

The 504 loan program is specifically designed for **major fixed asset purchases** — think real estate, large equipment, and facility construction or improvement.

**How it's structured (this is unique):**

The 504 loan involves three parties:
1. **A bank or lender** provides 50% of the project cost
2. **A Certified Development Company (CDC)** — an SBA-certified nonprofit — provides up to 40%
3. **You (the borrower)** contribute at least 10% as a down payment

**Loan details:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Maximum CDC portion | $5,000,000 (up to $5.5 million for manufacturing or energy projects) |
| Total project size | Can exceed $10 million (bank portion has no SBA cap) |
| Interest rates | Below-market fixed rates (typically in the 5-7% range) |
| Repayment terms | 10 years (equipment) or 20-25 years (real estate) |
| Down payment | 10% minimum (15% for new businesses or special-purpose properties) |

**What you can use it for:**
- Purchasing land or existing buildings
- Building new facilities
- Renovating or modernizing existing facilities
- Purchasing long-term machinery and equipment
- Refinancing debt related to business expansion

**What you cannot use it for:**
- Working capital
- Inventory
- Debt consolidation (unless related to expansion)

**Who qualifies:**
- For-profit company in the U.S.
- Net worth under $15 million
- Average net income under $5 million after taxes for the preceding two years
- Must create or retain jobs, or meet public policy goals

**Best for:** Businesses buying commercial real estate or expensive equipment that want long-term, fixed-rate financing with a low down payment.

### SBA Microloans

For smaller funding needs, the SBA Microloan program provides loans through **nonprofit intermediary lenders** (not banks).

**Loan details:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Maximum loan amount | $50,000 |
| Average loan amount | ~$13,000 |
| Interest rates | 8-13% (set by the intermediary lender) |
| Repayment terms | Up to 6 years |
| Collateral | Varies by lender; often personal guarantee required |

**What you can use it for:**
- Working capital
- Inventory or supplies
- Furniture or fixtures
- Machinery or equipment
- **Cannot be used to buy real estate or pay existing debts**

**Who qualifies:**
- For-profit small businesses
- Certain nonprofit childcare centers
- Startups are eligible (this is a key advantage)
- Credit requirements are more flexible than 7(a) or 504

**Best for:** Startups, very small businesses, and entrepreneurs who need a modest amount of funding and may not qualify for larger loan programs. We cover microloans in much more detail in our [complete microloan guide](/microloans-small-business).

### SBA Disaster Loans

When a federally declared disaster strikes, the SBA provides **low-interest disaster loans** to help businesses recover.

**Loan details:**
- Up to **$2 million** for physical damage repair
- Up to **$2 million** for economic injury (working capital)
- Interest rates as low as **4%** for businesses (lower for nonprofits)
- Repayment terms up to **30 years**

**Who qualifies:** Businesses in areas affected by a federally declared disaster.

**How to apply:** Directly through the SBA at [disasterloanassistance.sba.gov](https://disasterloanassistance.sba.gov).

### SBA Community Advantage Loans

A relatively newer program focused on **underserved markets** — including businesses in low-income communities, veteran-owned businesses, and businesses in rural areas.

**Loan details:**
- Maximum: **$350,000**
- Similar terms to 7(a) loans
- Available through mission-based lenders (CDFIs, nonprofit lenders)

**Best for:** Businesses in underserved communities that may have difficulty accessing traditional SBA lenders.

## SBA Loan Interest Rates in 2026

SBA loan interest rates are tied to the **prime rate** (currently around 7.5% as of early 2026) plus a spread that the SBA caps.

**Current rate ranges:**

| Loan Type | Rate Range (2026) |
|-----------|------------------|
| 7(a) — variable | 10.0% - 13.0% |
| 7(a) — fixed | Varies by lender |
| SBA Express | 10.5% - 14.0% |
| 504 (CDC portion) | 5.5% - 7.0% (fixed) |
| Microloans | 8.0% - 13.0% |
| Disaster loans | 4.0% (businesses) |

**How rates are determined:** Lenders can charge up to the SBA's maximum spread above prime. The actual rate you get depends on your creditworthiness, the loan amount, and the lender's policies.

**Pro tip:** Rates are negotiable. If one SBA lender quotes you prime + 4.75%, another might offer prime + 2.75% for the same loan. Always get quotes from at least 2-3 lenders.

## SBA Loan Eligibility Requirements

While specific requirements vary by program, here are the general eligibility criteria for SBA loans:

### Basic Requirements

- **Business type:** Must be a for-profit small business operating in the U.S. or its territories
- **Size:** Must meet the SBA's definition of "small" for your industry (check at [sba.gov/size-standards](https://www.sba.gov/size-standards))
- **Owner character:** No recent bankruptcies, no criminal record (some exceptions), no current federal debt delinquency
- **Owner investment:** You must have invested your own time or money (the SBA wants "skin in the game")
- **Inability to get credit elsewhere:** You must show that you can't get comparable terms from non-SBA sources

### Credit Score Requirements

The SBA itself doesn't set a minimum credit score, but in practice:

| Loan Type | Typical Minimum Credit Score |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| 7(a) loan | 680+ (some lenders accept 650+) |
| SBA Express | 680+ |
| 504 loan | 680+ |
| Microloans | 620+ (some accept lower) |
| Community Advantage | 620+ |

**What if your credit isn't great?** Microloans and Community Advantage loans are your best options. You can also work with a CDFI (Community Development Financial Institution) or a nonprofit lender that specializes in working with borrowers who have credit challenges.

### Documentation You'll Need

Prepare these documents before you apply:

**Business documents:**
- Business plan (especially for startups)
- Business financial statements (profit & loss, balance sheet, cash flow)
- Business tax returns (last 3 years)
- Business licenses and permits
- Articles of incorporation or organization
- Lease agreements
- List of business debts

**Personal documents:**
- Personal financial statement (SBA Form 413)
- Personal tax returns (last 3 years)
- Resume showing relevant experience
- Government-issued ID

**Loan-specific documents:**
- SBA Form 1919 (Borrower Information Form)
- Loan application history
- Collateral documentation
- Use of proceeds plan (how you'll spend the money)

## How to Apply for an SBA Loan: Step by Step

### Step 1: Determine Which Loan You Need

Ask yourself:
- **How much do I need?** Under $50K → Microloan. $50K-$5M → 7(a). Major fixed assets → 504.
- **What's it for?** Real estate → 504. Working capital → 7(a). Startup costs → Microloan or 7(a).
- **How fast do I need it?** Urgently → SBA Express. Can wait 60-90 days → Standard 7(a) or 504.

### Step 2: Check Your Eligibility

- Review the SBA's size standards for your industry
- Check your personal credit score (Credit Karma and Experian offer free scores)
- Make sure you don't have any disqualifying factors (recent bankruptcy, criminal history, federal debt)

### Step 3: Prepare Your Documentation

Gather everything listed in the documentation section above. The more organized and complete your application package, the faster it moves through the process.

**Pro tip:** Create a "loan application binder" (physical or digital) with tabs for each document category. Lenders notice when applicants are organized — it signals that you'll manage the loan responsibly.

### Step 4: Find an SBA-Approved Lender

Not every bank offers SBA loans. Here's how to find one:

- **SBA Lender Match** (lendermatch.sba.gov) — Free tool that connects you with SBA lenders based on your location and needs
- **SBA Preferred Lenders** — These lenders can approve SBA loans without waiting for SBA review, which speeds up the process significantly
- **Local banks and credit unions** — Many community banks are active SBA lenders
- **Online SBA lenders** — Companies like SmartBiz, Funding Circle, and Lendio offer SBA loans with streamlined online applications

**Apply to at least 2-3 lenders.** Rates, fees, and approval criteria vary. Shopping around can save you thousands over the life of the loan.

### Step 5: Submit Your Application

Once you've chosen a lender, submit your complete application package. Expect the lender to:
- Review your application for completeness
- Pull your credit report
- Analyze your financial statements
- Potentially request additional documentation
- Conduct a site visit (for larger loans)

### Step 6: Wait for Approval and Closing

**Timeline expectations:**
- SBA Express: 36 hours for SBA response, 2-4 weeks total
- 7(a) Small Loan: 2-4 weeks
- Standard 7(a): 30-60 days
- 504 Loan: 60-90 days

After approval, you'll go through a closing process similar to a mortgage — signing loan documents, establishing collateral, and funding the loan.

## 7 Tips to Improve Your Chances of SBA Loan Approval

### 1. Get Your Credit Right Before You Apply

If your credit score is below 680, spend 3-6 months improving it before applying. Pay down credit card balances, dispute any errors on your credit report, and don't open new credit accounts.

### 2. Write a Strong Business Plan

Lenders want to see that you have a clear plan for how the loan will generate enough revenue to cover repayment. Your business plan should include:
- Executive summary
- Market analysis
- Revenue projections (realistic, not optimistic)
- How you'll use the loan funds specifically
- Management team experience

### 3. Show Strong Cash Flow

The single most important factor in loan approval is **your ability to repay**. Lenders calculate your Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) — your net operating income divided by your total debt payments. A DSCR of **1.25 or higher** is typically required (meaning you earn $1.25 for every $1 in debt payments).

### 4. Offer Collateral

While SBA loans don't always require full collateral coverage, offering assets (real estate, equipment, accounts receivable) strengthens your application significantly.

### 5. Bring a Down Payment

Most SBA loans require 10-20% down. Having more than the minimum shows commitment and reduces the lender's risk.

### 6. Work with an SBA-Preferred Lender

Preferred lenders have delegated authority to approve loans without submitting them to the SBA for review. This means faster processing and often more favorable terms because these lenders are experienced with SBA programs.

### 7. Consider an SBA Resource Partner

Free resources exist to help you prepare:
- **SCORE** (score.org) — Free mentoring from experienced business professionals
- **Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs)** — Free consulting and training at over 1,000 locations nationwide
- **Women's Business Centers** — Specialized support for women entrepreneurs
- **Veterans Business Outreach Centers** — Support for veteran business owners

These organizations can review your business plan, help you prepare your loan application, and even introduce you to SBA lenders.

## SBA Loan Fees and Costs

SBA loans come with fees in addition to interest. Here's what to expect:

### Guarantee Fee

The SBA charges a guarantee fee based on the loan amount and maturity:

| Loan Amount | Guarantee Fee |
|------------|--------------|
| Up to $150,000 | 0% (waived for loans under $150,000 as of 2024) |
| $150,001 - $700,000 | 3.0% of guaranteed portion |
| $700,001 - $1,000,000 | 3.5% of guaranteed portion |
| Over $1,000,000 | 3.75% of guaranteed portion |

### Other Potential Fees

- **Packaging fees:** Some lenders charge $2,000-$4,000 to prepare your application
- **Closing costs:** Legal fees, appraisal, title search — typically 2-5% of loan amount
- **Annual service fee:** 0.55% of the outstanding guaranteed portion (paid by the lender but sometimes passed to borrowers)

**Pro tip:** Many SBA fees are negotiable or can be rolled into the loan. Ask your lender to explain every fee and whether any can be reduced.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to get an SBA loan?

The typical timeline is **30-90 days** from application to funding for standard 7(a) and 504 loans. SBA Express loans can be processed in **2-4 weeks**. The biggest delays come from incomplete documentation, so having everything ready before you apply speeds things up significantly.

### What credit score do I need for an SBA loan?

While the SBA doesn't set a minimum, most lenders want to see a credit score of **680 or higher** for 7(a) and 504 loans. Microloans and Community Advantage loans may accept scores as low as **620**. Some CDFI lenders work with borrowers who have even lower scores.

### Can I get an SBA loan for a startup?

Yes, but it's more challenging. Startups typically need a **strong business plan, relevant industry experience, a solid personal credit history, and a meaningful down payment** (usually 20-30%). Microloans are often the most accessible SBA option for startups.

### Can I get an SBA loan with bad credit?

It depends on how bad. A score of 650 may still qualify for some 7(a) lenders, and microloans may accept lower scores. Below 620, you'll likely need to improve your credit first or explore non-SBA alternatives like CDFI loans or Kiva.

### What can I use an SBA loan for?

SBA 7(a) loans can be used for virtually any legitimate business purpose — working capital, equipment, real estate, inventory, debt refinancing, and business acquisition. SBA 504 loans are limited to fixed assets (real estate and major equipment). Microloans cannot be used for real estate or to pay off existing debt.

### Do SBA loans require collateral?

The SBA requires lenders to secure loans with available collateral, but **loans will not be declined solely due to insufficient collateral** if all other criteria are met. For loans under $50,000, collateral is often not required. For larger loans, expect the lender to request business assets, real estate, or personal guarantees.

### Can I have more than one SBA loan?

Yes. You can have multiple SBA loans as long as the total doesn't exceed the maximum for each program and you demonstrate the ability to repay all of them. Many businesses have both a 7(a) loan for working capital and a 504 loan for real estate.

---

## Final Thoughts

SBA loans are one of the best financing options available to small businesses in America. The government guarantee means better rates, longer terms, and more accessible approval requirements than you'd get with conventional bank loans.

The application process takes work — there's no getting around the paperwork and preparation involved. But the payoff is access to capital that can genuinely transform your business, whether you're buying your first piece of equipment or expanding into a second location.

Start by figuring out which SBA loan type fits your needs, get your documentation in order, and reach out to 2-3 SBA-approved lenders. Take advantage of free resources like SCORE mentors and SBDCs. And don't get discouraged if the first lender says no — approval rates vary significantly between lenders, and the right one is out there.

Your business is worth the effort.
