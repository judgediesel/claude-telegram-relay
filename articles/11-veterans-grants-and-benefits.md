If you served in the United States military, you earned more than a thank-you. You earned access to one of the most comprehensive benefits systems in the world — covering everything from healthcare and disability compensation to free education, home loans with zero down payment, and direct financial grants.

The problem? **Most veterans don't use all the benefits they've earned.** According to the VA, millions of eligible veterans aren't enrolled in VA healthcare. Billions in education benefits go unused every year. And many veterans don't even know about state-specific grants and programs available right where they live.

This guide covers every major grant, benefit, and financial assistance program available to veterans in 2026. Whether you served for 4 years or 30, whether you're a recent separatee or a Vietnam-era vet, there is money and support waiting for you.

**You earned it. Let's make sure you get it.**

## VA Disability Compensation: Monthly Tax-Free Payments

If you were injured or developed a medical condition during your service — or if your service made an existing condition worse — you may qualify for **VA disability compensation**. This is a monthly, tax-free payment that you receive for the rest of your life.

### How Much Can You Receive?

Disability compensation is based on your **disability rating**, which the VA assigns on a scale from 0% to 100% in increments of 10%. Here are the 2026 monthly payment rates for a single veteran with no dependents:

| Disability Rating | Monthly Payment (2026) |
|---|---|
| 10% | $175.51 |
| 20% | $347.06 |
| 30% | $537.42 |
| 40% | $774.39 |
| 50% | $1,102.81 |
| 60% | $1,395.79 |
| 70% | $1,759.07 |
| 80% | $2,044.83 |
| 90% | $2,298.20 |
| 100% | $3,832.39 |

**Veterans with dependents receive higher amounts.** A 100%-rated veteran with a spouse and child can receive over $4,200 per month. These payments are **completely tax-free** at the federal and state level.

### What Conditions Qualify?

Almost any physical or mental health condition connected to your military service can qualify, including:

- **Physical injuries** — back pain, knee injuries, hearing loss, tinnitus, traumatic brain injury
- **Mental health conditions** — PTSD, anxiety, depression, insomnia
- **Chronic illnesses** — cancer, diabetes, heart disease (if service-connected)
- **Presumptive conditions** — certain conditions the VA automatically assumes are service-connected based on where and when you served (Agent Orange exposure, Gulf War illness, burn pit exposure under the PACT Act)

### The PACT Act: Expanded Coverage for Toxic Exposure

The **Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act** (signed in 2022) is the largest expansion of VA healthcare and benefits in decades. If you were exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, radiation, or other toxic substances during service, you may now qualify for benefits even without proving a direct service connection.

**Key PACT Act benefits:**
- Expanded VA healthcare eligibility for post-9/11 combat veterans
- New presumptive conditions for burn pit and toxic exposure veterans
- Coverage for veterans who served in Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations
- No deadline to apply — but earlier is better

### How to Apply for Disability Compensation

1. **Gather your evidence** — service medical records, VA medical records, private medical records, buddy statements from fellow service members
2. **File your claim** at [va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim/) or call **1-800-827-1000**
3. **Attend your C&P exam** — the VA will schedule a Compensation & Pension exam to evaluate your condition
4. **Receive your rating** — the VA will assign a disability percentage and begin monthly payments

**Pro tip:** Consider working with a **Veterans Service Organization (VSO)** like the DAV, VFW, or American Legion. They provide **free claims assistance** and can dramatically improve your chances of getting the correct rating. Find an accredited VSO representative at [va.gov/vso](https://www.va.gov/vso/).

## Education Benefits: The GI Bill and Beyond

Education benefits are among the most valuable benefits veterans have earned. The GI Bill alone can be worth **over $150,000** in tuition, housing, and book stipends.

### Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)

If you served on active duty after September 10, 2001, the **Post-9/11 GI Bill** covers:

- **Full tuition and fees** at any public university (or up to roughly $28,937/year at private schools in 2026)
- **Monthly housing allowance** — equal to the E-5 with dependents BAH rate for your school's zip code (typically $1,500 to $3,500/month)
- **Books and supplies stipend** — up to $1,000 per year
- **Up to 36 months** of benefits (about 4 academic years)

**Eligibility:** You need at least 90 days of aggregate active-duty service after 9/10/2001, or 30 continuous days if discharged for a service-connected disability. Your benefit level (50% to 100%) depends on your total time served.

### Forever GI Bill Updates

The **Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act** (Forever GI Bill) removed the 15-year time limit for using Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. If you were discharged on or after January 1, 2013, **your benefits never expire**.

### Transfer Benefits to Dependents

Active-duty service members with at least 6 years of service can **transfer unused GI Bill benefits to a spouse or children**. This is an incredible benefit — you could essentially pay for your child's entire college education.

**Important:** You must transfer benefits **while still serving**. You cannot transfer after separation. Talk to your base education office well before your ETS date.

### Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) — Chapter 31

If you have a **service-connected disability** and face barriers to employment, the **Veteran Readiness and Employment program** (formerly Vocational Rehabilitation) provides:

- Full tuition coverage for college, trade school, or vocational training
- Monthly living stipend during training
- Resume help, job coaching, and employment placement
- Assistive technology and workplace accommodations
- Self-employment support (including grants for starting a business)

**Key advantage:** VR&E can cover graduate school and professional degrees. It can also be used **after** your GI Bill benefits are exhausted.

**Eligibility:** You need at least a 10% service-connected disability rating and an employment barrier related to your disability. Apply at [va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/).

### Scholarships and Grants for Veterans

Beyond the GI Bill, many organizations offer **scholarships specifically for veterans**:

- **Pat Tillman Foundation** — up to $10,000/year for post-9/11 veterans and military spouses
- **Scholarships for Military Children** — $2,000 grants through the Fisher House Foundation
- **AMVETS Scholarships** — multiple awards ranging from $1,000 to $12,000
- **Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA)** — scholarship database and resources
- **Yellow Ribbon Program** — participating schools agree to cover tuition costs beyond the GI Bill cap (making expensive private schools affordable)

## Housing Assistance: VA Loans, Grants, and Programs

### VA Home Loans: The Best Mortgage in America

The VA home loan is, without exaggeration, **the best mortgage product available to any American**. Here's why:

- **$0 down payment** — buy a home with nothing down
- **No private mortgage insurance (PMI)** — saves you $100 to $300 per month compared to conventional loans
- **Lower interest rates** — typically 0.25% to 0.5% below conventional mortgage rates
- **No prepayment penalties**
- **Easier qualification standards** — more flexible credit and income requirements
- **Reusable** — you can use your VA loan benefit multiple times throughout your life

**Who qualifies:** Veterans, active-duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members (with qualifying service), and eligible surviving spouses. You'll need a **Certificate of Eligibility (COE)**, which you can get at [va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/how-to-request-coe](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/how-to-request-coe/).

**2026 VA loan limits:** For most veterans with full entitlement, there is **no loan limit** — the VA will guarantee loans of any amount (though lenders may have their own limits).

### Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grants

Veterans with certain severe service-connected disabilities can receive grants to **build or modify a home** for accessibility:

- **SAH Grant** — up to **$117,014** (2026) for building, buying, or modifying a home for wheelchair accessibility and other needs
- **SHA Grant (Special Housing Adaptation)** — up to **$46,809** (2026) for modifying an existing home
- **TRA Grant (Temporary Residence Adaptation)** — up to **$47,130** for temporary modifications to a family member's home

These are **outright grants, not loans** — you don't pay them back.

### HUD-VASH: Housing for Homeless Veterans

The **HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH)** program combines Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8) with VA case management to help homeless veterans find and keep permanent housing.

**What you get:**
- A rental voucher that covers most or all of your rent
- Ongoing case management from the VA
- Mental health and substance abuse treatment support
- Help with employment and benefits enrollment

**How to apply:** Contact your local VA Medical Center or call the **National Call Center for Homeless Veterans** at **1-877-4AID-VET (1-877-424-3838)**.

### Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF)

If you're a veteran at risk of homelessness — or already experiencing it — the **SSVF program** provides:

- Short-term financial assistance for rent, utilities, and deposits
- Help finding and securing housing
- Connection to VA and community resources
- Case management and outreach

This program is available to veterans and their families with household incomes below 50% of the area median income. Find an SSVF provider at [va.gov/homeless/ssvf](https://www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a disability rating to get VA benefits?

No. Many VA benefits are available to all veterans regardless of disability status. VA healthcare, GI Bill education benefits, VA home loans, and employment programs do not require a disability rating. However, disability compensation, VR&E, and some housing grants do require a service-connected disability rating.

### Can I receive VA disability compensation and Social Security at the same time?

Yes. VA disability compensation and Social Security benefits are completely separate programs. You can receive both simultaneously, and your VA compensation will not reduce your Social Security payments. VA disability is also tax-free, while Social Security may be partially taxable.

### What if I received a less-than-honorable discharge?

You may still be eligible for some VA benefits depending on your specific discharge characterization. Veterans with Other Than Honorable (OTH) discharges can apply for a **character of discharge review**. The VA can also make individual determinations about benefit eligibility. Contact a VSO for free help navigating this process.

### How long does a VA disability claim take?

As of 2026, the average processing time for an initial VA disability claim is approximately **120 to 180 days**. Claims filed through the VA's online portal at va.gov tend to be processed faster. Working with a VSO and submitting complete evidence upfront can significantly speed up the process.

### Can National Guard and Reserve members get VA benefits?

Yes, but eligibility depends on the specific benefit and your service history. If you were activated for federal service (Title 10 orders), you generally qualify for most VA benefits. Some programs like VA healthcare and the Post-9/11 GI Bill require a minimum period of active-duty service. Check your specific eligibility at va.gov or with a VSO.

### Are veterans grants taxable?

VA disability compensation, DIC payments, and VA grants (like SAH grants) are **not taxable** at the federal or state level. GI Bill housing allowances and stipends are also tax-free. However, some state veteran bonuses may be taxable depending on your state's laws.

### What is the best way to find all the benefits I qualify for?

Start at [va.gov](https://www.va.gov/) and use their benefits explorer tools. Then connect with a local **Veterans Service Organization (VSO)** — they will review your service record and help you identify every benefit you're entitled to, completely free of charge. You can also call the VA benefits hotline at **1-800-827-1000**.
