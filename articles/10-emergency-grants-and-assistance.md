## Government Emergency Programs

The federal and state governments run several programs designed to help people in financial crisis. These programs can provide significant assistance, though some may take a bit longer to process than the immediate-help resources above.

### Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA)

If you're behind on rent and facing eviction, emergency rental assistance programs can pay your landlord directly. These programs are funded by the federal government but run at the state and local level.

**What's covered:**
- Back rent (often up to 12 months)
- Future rent payments (up to 3 months in some areas)
- Utility arrears
- Moving costs in some programs

**How to apply:** Search "[your state] emergency rental assistance" or call 211 to find your local program.

### LIHEAP — Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program

LIHEAP helps low-income families pay their heating and cooling bills. The program has two parts:

- **Regular LIHEAP:** Helps with seasonal heating and cooling costs
- **Crisis LIHEAP:** Available if you've received a shutoff notice or are already disconnected — this is processed faster as an emergency

**Who qualifies:** Generally, households earning up to 150% of the federal poverty level, though it varies by state.

**How to apply:** Contact your state's LIHEAP office or call the National Energy Assistance Referral hotline at **1-866-674-6327**.

### Emergency SNAP Benefits (Food Stamps)

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helps families buy groceries. If you're in a crisis, you may qualify for **expedited SNAP benefits**, which are processed within 7 days instead of the usual 30.

**You may qualify for expedited SNAP if:**
- Your monthly income is less than $150 and you have less than $100 in the bank
- Your monthly rent and utilities exceed your monthly income
- You are a destitute migrant or seasonal farm worker

**How to apply:** Visit your local Department of Social Services or apply online through your state's SNAP portal. Tell them you need expedited processing.

### TANF — Temporary Assistance for Needy Families

TANF provides cash assistance to low-income families with children. Some states also offer **Emergency Assistance (EA)** through TANF, which can help with:

- Emergency housing costs
- Utility payments
- Other critical needs

Each state runs its own TANF program with different rules and benefit amounts. Contact your state's Department of Social Services to apply.

### Emergency Medicaid

If you have a medical emergency and no insurance, you may qualify for **Emergency Medicaid**. This covers emergency room visits, emergency surgeries, and other urgent medical care — even if you don't normally qualify for regular Medicaid.

**How to apply:** Go to the emergency room. Hospitals are required to treat you regardless of your ability to pay. Ask to speak with a financial counselor at the hospital to apply for Emergency Medicaid.

### General Assistance / General Relief

Many states and counties offer **General Assistance (GA)** or **General Relief** programs for people who don't qualify for other programs. These typically provide:

- Small monthly cash payments
- Emergency one-time payments
- Help accessing other services

Eligibility and benefits vary widely by state and county. Call 211 or your local Department of Social Services to ask about General Assistance in your area.

## How to Ask for Help (Overcoming the Stigma)

This might be the hardest part. Many people feel ashamed or embarrassed to ask for help. Here's what you need to know:

**These programs exist because of people like you.** They were created specifically to help hardworking people who hit a rough patch. Using them is not a sign of weakness. It's exactly what they're there for.

Here are some tips to make it easier:

- **Start with a phone call.** Dialing 211 is private and confidential. You can explain your situation to someone who hears stories like yours every single day.
- **Be honest about what you need.** The more specific you are, the better they can help you.
- **Apply to multiple programs.** Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Apply for several types of assistance at the same time.
- **Bring documentation.** When you apply, bring your ID, proof of income (pay stubs or a letter from your employer), a lease or mortgage statement, utility bills, and any shutoff or eviction notices. Having these ready speeds up the process.
- **Ask about other programs.** Caseworkers often know about resources you might not find on your own. Ask, "Is there anything else I might qualify for?"

Remember: asking for help today puts you in a stronger position to help someone else tomorrow.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Emergency Grants and Assistance

### Do I have to pay back emergency grants?

No. Emergency grants are **free money that you do not have to repay**. That's the difference between a grant and a loan. Government emergency assistance programs like SNAP, LIHEAP, and Emergency Rental Assistance are also not loans — they're benefits you're entitled to based on your situation.

### How fast can I get emergency financial assistance?

It depends on the program. Some organizations, like the Salvation Army and local churches, can provide help **within 24 to 72 hours**. Government programs like expedited SNAP can be approved within **7 days**. Emergency Rental Assistance timelines vary but often take **2 to 4 weeks**. Calling 211 is the fastest way to find what's available immediately in your area.

### Do I need good credit to qualify for emergency assistance?

No. Emergency grants and assistance programs **do not check your credit score**. Eligibility is typically based on your income, household size, and the nature of your emergency — not your credit history.

### Can I get emergency help if I'm undocumented?

Some programs are available regardless of immigration status. Food banks and community meals generally do not ask about immigration status. Emergency medical care (EMTALA) is required by law regardless of status. Some state and local programs serve all residents. Call 211 to ask about resources available to you specifically — the call is confidential.

### What if I've already been denied assistance from one program?

**Don't give up.** Being denied by one program does not mean you'll be denied by all of them. Each organization has its own eligibility rules and funding. If one says no, ask them for referrals to other programs. Apply to multiple organizations at the same time. Call 211 for additional options you might not know about.
