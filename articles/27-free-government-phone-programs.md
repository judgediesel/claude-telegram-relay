Staying connected is not a luxury anymore -- it is a necessity. You need a phone to apply for jobs, schedule doctor appointments, stay in touch with your children's school, and access government services. But when money is tight, a monthly phone bill can feel impossible.

The good news is that the federal government and multiple state programs provide **free or heavily subsidized cell phones and service** to low-income Americans. In 2026, millions of people qualify for a free smartphone with monthly talk, text, and data -- and most do not even realize it.

This guide covers every major free government phone program available right now, including who qualifies, what you get, and exactly how to apply.

## The Lifeline Program: The Foundation of Free Government Phones

The **Lifeline program** is the original and most well-known government phone assistance program. Established by the FCC in 1985 and expanded to include wireless service in 2005, Lifeline provides a monthly discount on phone service for eligible low-income households.

### What Does Lifeline Provide?

Lifeline offers a **$9.25 per month discount** on phone or internet service. Many Lifeline providers absorb the remaining cost entirely, which means you can get service at **no charge whatsoever**. Depending on your provider, a typical Lifeline plan includes:

- A **free smartphone** (typically an Android device)
- **Unlimited talk and text**
- **4.5 GB to 10 GB of monthly data** (varies by provider; some offer unlimited data)
- **No monthly bill, no contracts, no credit check**

Some providers offer upgraded phones or additional data for a small monthly fee, but the base plan is completely free.

### Who Qualifies for the Lifeline Program?

You qualify for Lifeline if your **household income is at or below 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines** or if you participate in certain federal assistance programs.

#### Income-Based Eligibility (2026 Federal Poverty Guidelines)

| Household Size | 135% FPL (Annual Income Limit) |
|---|---|
| 1 person | $21,546 |
| 2 people | $29,214 |
| 3 people | $36,882 |
| 4 people | $44,550 |
| 5 people | $52,218 |
| 6 people | $59,886 |

*Add $7,668 for each additional household member.*

#### Program-Based Eligibility

You automatically qualify if you or someone in your household participates in any of these programs:

- **SNAP** (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program / food stamps)
- **Medicaid**
- **Supplemental Security Income (SSI)**
- **Federal Public Housing Assistance** (Section 8 / Housing Choice Vouchers)
- **Veterans Pension and Survivors Benefit**
- **Bureau of Indian Affairs General Assistance**
- **Tribally Administered Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)**
- **Tribal Head Start** (income qualifying only)
- **Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR)**

Many states add their own qualifying programs. For example, some states include participation in **WIC, LIHEAP, free school lunch programs, or state Medicaid programs** as qualifying criteria.

### How to Apply for Lifeline

**Step 1: Check your eligibility**

Visit the **National Verifier** at [checklifeline.org](https://www.checklifeline.org) or call **1-800-234-9473**. The National Verifier is the FCC's official system for confirming Lifeline eligibility. You can check eligibility online in about 5 minutes.

**Step 2: Choose a Lifeline provider**

Different providers operate in different states. You can find providers in your area at [lifelinesupport.org](https://www.lifelinesupport.org/companies-near-me/). Major Lifeline providers include:

- **Assurance Wireless** (T-Mobile network) -- available in 40+ states
- **SafeLink Wireless** (T-Mobile/Verizon network) -- available in all 50 states
- **Q Link Wireless** (T-Mobile network) -- available in 48 states
- **TruConnect** -- available in 40+ states
- **StandUp Wireless** -- available in 25+ states
- **enTouch Wireless** -- available in 30+ states
- **Life Wireless** -- available in 40+ states

**Step 3: Complete your application**

You can apply in one of three ways:

1. **Online** through the National Verifier at [checklifeline.org](https://www.checklifeline.org)
2. **Through your chosen provider's website** (they will submit to the National Verifier on your behalf)
3. **By mail** using a paper application (download at [lifelinesupport.org](https://www.lifelinesupport.org))

**What you need to apply:**

- Full name, date of birth, and last four digits of your Social Security number
- Home address (P.O. boxes are not accepted as your primary address)
- Proof of eligibility: a benefit award letter, income documentation (tax return, pay stubs, Social Security statement), or screenshot of your benefits account
- A valid government-issued ID

**Processing time:** Most applications are approved within **minutes** when submitted online. If additional documentation is needed, processing can take up to **2 weeks**. Once approved, your free phone typically arrives within **7 to 10 business days**.

### Important Lifeline Rules

- **One per household.** Only one Lifeline benefit is allowed per household (defined as people living at the same address who share income and expenses).
- **Annual recertification.** You must recertify your eligibility every year. The National Verifier will contact you when it is time. If you do not recertify, you will lose your benefit.
- **Usage requirement.** You must use your Lifeline service at least once every 30 days (make a call, send a text, or use data). If you do not, your service may be deactivated.

## The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP): What Happened and What Replaced It

The **Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)** was a massive pandemic-era benefit that provided a **$30 per month internet discount** (or $75 on tribal lands) plus a **one-time $100 device discount** for eligible households. At its peak, over 23 million households were enrolled.

### ACP Ended in June 2024

Congress did not approve additional funding, and the ACP officially wound down on **June 1, 2024**. The last fully funded month of service was May 2024. This left millions of families scrambling for alternatives.

### What Replaced the ACP?

While no single federal program has directly replaced the ACP at the same scale, several options now exist:

#### FCC Efforts and Provider Commitments

After the ACP ended, the FCC secured voluntary commitments from major internet providers to offer **low-cost plans** for former ACP households:

- **Comcast Internet Essentials** -- $9.95/month for 50 Mbps
- **AT&T Access** -- $0 to $30/month for low-income households (speeds up to 100 Mbps for qualifying addresses)
- **Spectrum Internet Assist** -- $17.99/month for 30 Mbps
- **T-Mobile Project 10Million** -- Free internet for eligible student households
- **Verizon Forward** -- $20/month for qualifying households

#### State-Level Replacement Programs

Several states launched their own broadband assistance programs to fill the ACP gap:

- **California:** The **California Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program** includes a low-income connectivity component. The state also has the **LifeLine program** at the state level providing phone and internet discounts.
- **New York:** The **Affordable Broadband Act** caps broadband prices for low-income New Yorkers at $15 to $20/month.
- **Colorado:** The **Affordable Connectivity Fund** provides direct subsidies to qualifying residents.
- **Vermont:** The **Vermont Community Broadband Fund** provides low-income internet subsidies.
- **Oregon:** The **Oregon Broadband Office** runs connectivity assistance programs.

#### The Proposed CONNECT Act

In 2025, members of Congress introduced the **Connecting Opportunities through Networks, Connectivity, and Technology (CONNECT) Act**, which would create a permanent successor to the ACP. As of early 2026, the legislation is still moving through Congress. Check [fcc.gov/acp](https://www.fcc.gov/acp) for the latest updates on federal broadband assistance programs.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Assurance Wireless** | T-Mobile | 10 GB/month | Unlimited | Unlimited | Mid-range Android | 40+ |

*Data amounts may vary by state and are subject to change. Check each provider's website for current offerings in your state.*

### Tips for Choosing a Provider

1. **Check coverage in your area.** Most free government phone providers use the T-Mobile network, but coverage varies by location. Use T-Mobile's coverage map at [t-mobile.com/coverage](https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/coverage-map) to check your area.
2. **Compare data amounts.** If you use your phone heavily for streaming, maps, or video calls, choose a provider with more data.
3. **Look at the phone itself.** Some providers offer newer phones with better cameras and more storage. Read reviews before choosing.
4. **Check upgrade options.** Some providers let you upgrade to a better phone or more data for a small additional monthly fee.
5. **Read the fine print.** Understand the terms of service, including what happens if you exceed your data limit.

## The "Obama Phone" Myth: Setting the Record Straight

The term "Obama phone" became widely used around 2012, but it is based on a misunderstanding. Here is the real history:

- **1985:** The FCC created the Lifeline program under **President Ronald Reagan** to provide discounted landline service to low-income Americans.
- **1996:** Under **President Bill Clinton**, the program was expanded through the Telecommunications Act.
- **2005:** Under **President George W. Bush**, the FCC approved Lifeline for wireless (cell phone) service.
- **2008-2012:** Participation exploded during the Great Recession, and the program became politically associated with President Obama -- even though he did not create it.
- **2016:** The FCC modernized Lifeline under the Obama administration to include broadband service, but the core phone benefit had existed for over 20 years at that point.

The bottom line: free government phones are a **bipartisan program** that has been supported by presidents of both parties for nearly four decades. It is not a partisan issue -- it is a safety net program.

## How to Get a Free Phone If You Are on Tribal Lands

If you live on federally recognized tribal lands, you qualify for an **enhanced Lifeline benefit** of up to **$34.25 per month** (compared to $9.25 for non-tribal subscribers). This higher subsidy means tribal Lifeline customers often receive:

## Common Problems and How to Solve Them

### "My Application Was Denied"

The most common reasons for denial:

- **Someone in your household already has Lifeline.** Only one benefit per household. If a family member already receives Lifeline, you cannot get a second one.
- **Address mismatch.** Your application address must match your ID or utility bills. Update your address with the National Verifier before reapplying.
- **Missing documentation.** If you did not provide sufficient proof of eligibility, you will receive a notice explaining what is needed. Submit the requested documents within the timeframe specified.
- **Income too high.** If your income exceeds 135% FPL, you may still qualify through a participating program like SNAP or Medicaid. Apply for those programs first, then reapply for Lifeline.

### "My Phone Stopped Working"

- **Did you miss recertification?** You must recertify your eligibility once a year. If you missed the deadline, contact your provider or the National Verifier to restart the process.
- **Non-usage deactivation.** If you did not use your phone for 30 consecutive days, your service may have been suspended. Contact your provider to reactivate.
- **Network issue.** Try restarting your phone, removing and reinserting the SIM card, and checking for network outages in your area.

### "I Moved to a New State"

If you move to a different state:

1. Contact your current Lifeline provider to see if they operate in your new state.
2. If not, you will need to transfer your benefit to a new provider. Call the Lifeline Support Center at **1-800-234-9473** for help.
3. Update your address with the National Verifier.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I keep my existing phone number if I switch to Lifeline?

Yes, in most cases. Federal regulations require that you be able to port (transfer) your existing phone number to a new provider. Let your new Lifeline provider know your current number when you sign up, and they will handle the transfer.

### Can I get a free iPhone through these programs?

Lifeline providers typically offer Android smartphones. iPhones are generally not available through the free programs. However, you can purchase an unlocked iPhone separately and use it with your free Lifeline SIM card and plan.

### Is there a free government phone program for seniors?

There is no separate senior-specific phone program, but many seniors qualify for Lifeline through **SSI, Medicaid, SNAP, or income eligibility**. If you are 65 or older and on a fixed income, you almost certainly qualify.

### Can undocumented immigrants get a free government phone?

Lifeline eligibility requires a valid Social Security number or documentation of lawful presence. However, some nonprofit organizations provide phones regardless of immigration status. Dial **2-1-1** for local resources.

### Can I have both Lifeline service and a regular phone plan?

Yes. You can have a Lifeline phone in addition to a paid phone plan on a separate line. However, only one Lifeline benefit is allowed per household.

### Do I need a permanent address to apply?

You need to provide an address, but it does not have to be a traditional home address. Homeless individuals can use a **shelter address or a temporary address** and still qualify for Lifeline.
