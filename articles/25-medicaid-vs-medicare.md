Medicaid and Medicare are the two largest government health insurance programs in the United States, together covering more than 150 million Americans. Despite their similar names, they serve different populations, cover different things, and work in fundamentally different ways. The confusion between the two is so common that even people already enrolled in one program sometimes don't understand what it covers — or that they might also qualify for the other.

If you're trying to figure out which program you qualify for, what each one actually pays for, or whether you can have both at the same time, this guide breaks it all down in plain language. No insurance jargon, no bureaucratic runaround — just the facts you need to make informed decisions about your healthcare coverage in 2026.

## The Core Difference: Medicaid vs Medicare at a Glance

The simplest way to remember the difference: **Medicare is based on age (or disability), while Medicaid is based on income.**

| Feature | Medicare | Medicaid |
|---|---|---|
| **Who it's for** | People 65+, certain disabilities, ESRD | Low-income individuals and families |
| **Based on** | Age or disability status | Income and financial need |
| **Funded by** | Federal government (payroll taxes) | Federal and state governments jointly |
| **Administered by** | Federal (CMS) | State governments (within federal guidelines) |
| **Cost to enrollee** | Premiums, deductibles, copays | Usually free or very low cost |
| **Uniform nationwide?** | Yes (mostly) | No — varies significantly by state |
| **Income test?** | No (for most parts) | Yes |

## What Is Medicare?

Medicare is a federal health insurance program primarily for Americans aged 65 and older. It was established in 1965 and is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Unlike Medicaid, Medicare is not based on your income — it's an earned benefit tied to your work history and age.

### Who Qualifies for Medicare?

You're eligible for Medicare if you meet any of the following criteria:

- **Age 65 or older** and a U.S. citizen or permanent legal resident who has lived in the U.S. for at least five consecutive years
- **Under 65 with a qualifying disability** and have received Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) for at least 24 months
- **Any age with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)** — permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant
- **Any age with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS/Lou Gehrig's disease)** — eligible immediately upon SSDI approval, no 24-month waiting period

You do **not** need to have low income to qualify for Medicare. A retired CEO and a retired janitor both qualify at age 65 as long as they (or their spouse) paid Medicare taxes for at least 10 years (40 quarters).

### The Four Parts of Medicare

Medicare is divided into four distinct parts, each covering different services:

#### Part A: Hospital Insurance

- **Covers:** Inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility care (up to 100 days), hospice care, some home health care
- **Premium:** $0 for most people (if you or your spouse paid Medicare taxes for 10+ years). If you don't qualify for premium-free Part A, you may pay up to $518/month in 2026
- **Deductible:** $1,676 per benefit period (2026)
- **Key detail:** Part A does NOT cover long-term nursing home care — only short-term skilled nursing after a qualifying hospital stay

#### Part B: Medical Insurance

- **Covers:** Doctor visits, outpatient care, preventive services, lab tests, mental health services, durable medical equipment, ambulance services
- **Premium:** Standard premium of $185/month in 2026 (higher earners pay more through IRMAA surcharges)
- **Deductible:** $257/year (2026)
- **Coinsurance:** You typically pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount after meeting the deductible
- **Key detail:** Part B covers many preventive services at no cost — annual wellness visits, flu shots, mammograms, colonoscopies, and more

#### Part C: Medicare Advantage

- **What it is:** An alternative to Original Medicare (Parts A and B) offered by private insurance companies approved by Medicare
- **Covers:** Everything Parts A and B cover, plus often additional benefits like dental, vision, hearing, and prescription drugs
- **Premium:** Varies by plan (you still pay the Part B premium plus any plan-specific premium, which may be $0)
- **Key detail:** Medicare Advantage plans use networks (HMO, PPO) — you may need referrals and have limited provider choices compared to Original Medicare

#### Part D: Prescription Drug Coverage

- **Covers:** Outpatient prescription medications
- **Premium:** Varies by plan, averaging around $40–55/month in 2026
- **Key detail:** Part D has a coverage gap ("donut hole") that has been largely closed — but you may still pay varying amounts depending on where you are in the benefit phases
- **Late enrollment penalty:** If you don't sign up for Part D when first eligible and don't have other creditable drug coverage, you'll pay a permanent penalty added to your premium

### What Medicare Does NOT Cover

This catches many people off guard. Original Medicare (Parts A and B) does **not** cover:

- Most dental care (cleanings, fillings, dentures)
- Routine eye exams and eyeglasses
- Hearing aids and hearing exams
- Long-term care (nursing home stays beyond skilled nursing)
- Cosmetic surgery
- Most care outside the United States

To fill these gaps, many Medicare beneficiaries purchase a **Medicare Supplement (Medigap) policy** or enroll in a **Medicare Advantage plan** that includes these additional benefits.

## What Is Medicaid?

Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health coverage to low-income Americans. Unlike Medicare, Medicaid eligibility is primarily based on your income and financial situation, not your age or work history. Each state runs its own Medicaid program within federal guidelines, which means eligibility rules, covered services, and program names vary significantly from state to state.

### Who Qualifies for Medicaid?

Medicaid covers several groups of people, but income is always the primary factor:

#### Adults Under 65

In the **40 states plus DC that have expanded Medicaid** under the Affordable Care Act, most adults aged 19–64 with household incomes at or below **138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)** qualify. For 2026, that translates to:

| Household Size | Annual Income Limit (138% FPL) | Monthly Income Limit |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | $21,597 | $1,800 |
| 2 | $29,160 | $2,430 |
| 3 | $36,723 | $3,060 |
| 4 | $44,286 | $3,691 |
| 5 | $51,849 | $4,321 |

In the **10 states that have NOT expanded Medicaid** (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin — though some are in various stages of implementation), adults without children often cannot qualify for Medicaid regardless of how low their income is. In these states, Medicaid is typically limited to pregnant women, parents of dependent children (at very low income levels), elderly individuals, and people with disabilities.

#### Children and Pregnant Women

- **Children:** Generally eligible at higher income levels than adults — many states cover children in families earning up to 200–300% of the FPL through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
- **Pregnant women:** Typically eligible at 138–200% FPL (varies by state), covering prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care

#### Elderly and Disabled Individuals

- **Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients:** Automatically eligible for Medicaid in most states
- **Elderly individuals** in nursing homes or needing long-term care services may qualify under special income and asset rules
- **People with disabilities** who meet income and asset requirements

### What Does Medicaid Cover?

Federal law requires state Medicaid programs to cover certain **mandatory benefits**:

- Inpatient and outpatient hospital services
- Physician services
- Laboratory and X-ray services
- Nursing facility services (for adults 21+)
- Home health services
- Prenatal care and delivery
- Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) services for children under 21
- Family planning services
- Federally qualified health center and rural health clinic services

States may also offer **optional benefits**, and most do, including:

- Prescription drugs (covered by all states, though technically optional)
- Dental services
- Vision services and eyeglasses
- Physical therapy and rehabilitation
- Hearing aids
- Mental health and substance abuse treatment
- Long-term care services and supports

### What Medicaid Costs

One of Medicaid's biggest advantages is its affordability. Most Medicaid beneficiaries pay **no premiums and no deductibles**. Some states charge small copayments — usually $1 to $4 per service — but these are minimal compared to private insurance or Medicare costs.

**For people below 100% FPL, copays cannot exceed nominal amounts, and providers must still serve you even if you can't pay the copay.**

## How to Apply for Medicare

### Initial Enrollment Period

If you're turning 65, your Initial Enrollment Period (IEP) is a **7-month window** that includes:

- 3 months before your 65th birthday month
- Your birthday month
- 3 months after your birthday month

If you're already receiving Social Security benefits, you'll be **automatically enrolled** in Medicare Parts A and B. Your Medicare card will arrive in the mail about three months before you turn 65.

### How to Sign Up

- **Online:** Visit **ssa.gov** (Social Security Administration) or **medicare.gov**
- **Phone:** Call Social Security at **1-800-772-1213** (TTY: 1-800-325-0778)
- **In person:** Visit your local Social Security office

### Annual Enrollment Period

Every year from **October 15 to December 7**, you can make changes to your Medicare coverage — switch between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage, change Advantage plans, or change Part D plans.

### Late Enrollment Penalties

If you don't enroll in Medicare when first eligible:

- **Part B:** Your premium increases by **10% for each 12-month period** you could have had Part B but didn't (this penalty lasts as long as you have Part B)
- **Part D:** Premium increases by **1% of the national base premium for each month** you were without creditable drug coverage

**Exception:** If you have employer-based insurance through your own or a spouse's active employment, you can delay enrollment without penalty.

## How to Apply for Medicaid

### Where to Apply

Because Medicaid is state-run, you apply through your state's Medicaid agency. Common methods include:

- **Online** through your state's Medicaid portal or **healthcare.gov** (which can determine if you qualify for Medicaid during the Marketplace application process)
- **By phone** through your state's Medicaid hotline
- **In person** at your local Department of Social Services or Department of Health office
- **By mail** using a paper application

### What You'll Need

- Social Security numbers for all household members
- Proof of income (pay stubs, tax returns, Social Security statements)
- Proof of residency (utility bills, lease agreement)
- Proof of citizenship or immigration status
- Information about any current health insurance

### Processing Time

States are required to process Medicaid applications within **45 days** (90 days for disability-based applications). Many states process applications much faster — some within a few days for straightforward cases.

### Retroactive Coverage

A powerful feature of Medicaid that many people don't know about: **Medicaid can cover medical bills from up to 3 months before your application date**, as long as you would have been eligible during that time. If you have unpaid medical bills from recent months, applying for Medicaid now could help cover them.

## Can You Have Both? Understanding Dual Eligibility

Yes — approximately **12 million Americans** are "dual eligible," meaning they qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid simultaneously. This typically applies to:

- People 65 or older with low income
- People under 65 with disabilities who qualify for both SSDI (Medicare) and SSI/low-income (Medicaid)

### How Dual Coverage Works

When you have both programs:

- **Medicare is the primary payer** — it pays first for services it covers
- **Medicaid is the secondary payer** — it picks up remaining costs that Medicare doesn't cover
- **Medicaid may cover your Medicare premiums, deductibles, and copays** — reducing your out-of-pocket costs to near zero
- **Medicaid covers services Medicare doesn't** — like long-term care, dental, vision, and hearing

### Medicare Savings Programs

If you have Medicare and low income but don't qualify for full Medicaid, you may qualify for a **Medicare Savings Program (MSP)** that helps pay your Medicare costs:

| Program | Income Limit (2026, Individual) | What It Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) | ~100% FPL ($1,264/mo) | Part A & B premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, copays |
| Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB) | ~120% FPL ($1,517/mo) | Part B premium |
| Qualifying Individual (QI) | ~135% FPL ($1,706/mo) | Part B premium |
| Qualified Disabled Working Individual (QDWI) | ~200% FPL ($2,528/mo) | Part A premium |

### Extra Help (Low-Income Subsidy) for Part D

If you have Medicare and limited income, you may qualify for **Extra Help** — a federal program that pays for most of your Part D prescription drug costs. To qualify in 2026, your annual income must be below approximately $22,590 (individual) or $30,660 (married couple), and your resources must be below $17,220 (individual) or $34,360 (married couple).

Apply for Extra Help at **ssa.gov/extrahelp** or call **1-800-772-1213**.

## Common Misconceptions About Medicaid and Medicare

### Misconception 1: "Medicare is free"

Part A is premium-free for most people, but Part B costs $185/month (or more), Part D has its own premium, and there are deductibles and copays throughout. Many retirees spend $3,000–$6,000+ per year on Medicare-related costs.

### Misconception 2: "Medicaid is only for people who don't work"

Many Medicaid enrollees are working adults whose jobs don't offer affordable health insurance. In expansion states, a single adult earning up to about $21,597/year qualifies — that's someone working full-time at $10.38/hour.

### Misconception 3: "Medicare covers long-term nursing home care"

This is one of the most dangerous misconceptions in retirement planning. Medicare covers up to **100 days** of skilled nursing facility care after a qualifying hospital stay — and only the first 20 days are fully covered. After that, you pay a copay of $204.50/day (2026) for days 21–100. Beyond 100 days, Medicare pays nothing. Long-term nursing home care is primarily covered by **Medicaid** (for those who qualify) or paid out of pocket.

### Misconception 4: "If I have Medicare, I don't need anything else"

Original Medicare has significant gaps — no dental, no vision, no hearing, and 20% coinsurance on Part B services with no out-of-pocket maximum. Most Medicare beneficiaries need supplemental coverage through a Medigap plan, Medicare Advantage, or employer retiree benefits.

### Misconception 5: "Medicaid will take my house"

While Medicaid does have an estate recovery program (states can seek repayment from the estates of deceased Medicaid recipients for certain services), your home is generally **exempt** while you're living in it. Estate recovery rules vary by state and have important exceptions — especially for surviving spouses, dependent children, and certain disabled family members. Consult with an elder law attorney if this is a concern.

## Which Program Is Right for You?

### You Likely Qualify for Medicare If:

- You're 65 or older
- You've received SSDI for at least 24 months
- You have ESRD or ALS
- You (or your spouse) paid Medicare taxes for at least 10 years

### You Likely Qualify for Medicaid If:

- Your household income is below 138% FPL (in expansion states)
- You're pregnant with low income
- You have children and low household income
- You receive SSI
- You're elderly and need long-term care with limited income and assets

### You May Qualify for Both If:

- You're 65+ with income below your state's Medicaid threshold
- You're under 65 with a disability and low income
- You qualify for a Medicare Savings Program
