## Housing Grants and Assistance

### 1. HUD Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8)

Section 8 is the largest rental assistance program in the country. It pays a significant portion of your rent directly to your landlord.

**What you get:** The voucher covers the gap between 30% of your income and the fair market rent. If you earn $2,000/month and rent is $1,500, you'd pay $600 and the voucher covers $900.

**Who qualifies:**
- Single mothers with income below 50% of area median income
- Priority given to those below 30% of area median income
- Must pass a background check

**How to apply:** Contact your [local Public Housing Authority](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts). Apply to multiple locations — waitlists vary.

### 2. HUD Public Housing

If Section 8 waitlists are too long, public housing may be available sooner. These are government-owned apartments with rent based on your income.

**What you get:** Rent capped at **30% of your adjusted income**. A mom earning $1,500/month would pay about $450/month.

**Who qualifies:**
- Low-income families, with preference for single-parent households in many areas
- Income limits vary by location

**How to apply:** Same as Section 8 — contact your [local PHA](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts).

- **Mutual Self-Help Housing** — Build your own home with reduced costs

**How to apply:** Find your [state USDA office](https://www.rd.usda.gov/contact-us/state-offices).

### 4. Emergency Rental Assistance

Many states and cities still offer emergency rental assistance programs funded by federal dollars. These can cover:

Your U.S.-citizen children may qualify for many of these programs (SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP, school meals) even if you are undocumented. WIC is also available regardless of immigration status.
