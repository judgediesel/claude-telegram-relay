You filed the FAFSA. Maybe you got a Pell Grant. But here's the thing most students don't realize: **the Pell Grant is just the starting line, not the finish.**

There are hundreds of grants available to college students — from the federal government, your state, your school, private foundations, and community organizations. Many of them can be stacked together. And unlike loans, **you never have to pay a single dollar back.**

Yet every year, students leave billions of dollars in free money on the table because they don't know where to look.

This guide lays out **20 real ways to get grants for college in 2026** — with specific dollar amounts, eligibility requirements, deadlines, and direct links. Whether you're a first-generation student, a single parent going back to school, a minority student, or someone studying STEM, there's money out there with your name on it.

Let's go get it.

## Federal Grants You Might Not Know About

Most people know about the Pell Grant (up to **$7,395 per year** for the 2025-2026 award year). But the federal government offers several other grant programs that fly under the radar.

### 1. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)

**Amount:** $100 to $4,000 per year
**Who qualifies:** Undergraduate students with exceptional financial need — particularly those who also receive Pell Grants
**How to apply:** File the FAFSA. Your school's financial aid office handles FSEOG awards directly.

The FSEOG is a campus-based program, which means your school receives a set amount of funding from the federal government and distributes it to qualifying students. **Students with the lowest Student Aid Index (SAI) and who receive Pell Grants get first priority.**

Here's the catch: not every college participates, and funding is limited. Once it's gone, it's gone — even if you qualify. That's why filing your FAFSA early matters so much.

### 2. TEACH Grant

**Amount:** Up to $4,000 per year
**Who qualifies:** Students enrolled in programs leading to a teaching career in high-need fields
**Service requirement:** Teach for at least 4 years within 8 years of graduation at a low-income school

The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant is designed to help students who plan to become teachers. High-need fields include **math, science, special education, bilingual education, English language acquisition**, and other subjects listed on the Department of Education's Teacher Shortage Area Nationwide Listing.

**Important warning:** If you don't complete the teaching service obligation, your entire TEACH Grant converts into a federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan — with interest charged from the day it was disbursed. Make sure you're committed before accepting this one.

**Website:** [studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/teach](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/teach)

### 3. Children of Fallen Heroes Grant (Pell-Eligible)

**Amount:** Up to $7,395 per year (maximum Pell Grant)
**Who qualifies:** Students whose parent or guardian died in the line of duty as a public safety officer, firefighter, or member of the armed forces

Previously known as the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, this benefit was expanded and folded into the Pell Grant program under the FAFSA Simplification Act. Qualifying students now receive the **maximum Pell Grant amount regardless of their financial need or Student Aid Index**.

If you've lost a parent who served, you may be eligible for a full Pell Grant even if your family income would normally disqualify you.

**How to apply:** File the FAFSA and contact your school's financial aid office about your eligibility.

## State Grants: Free Money in Your Backyard

Every state runs its own financial aid programs, and many of them are generous. The key is knowing what your state offers — and applying on time, because state deadlines are often earlier than federal ones.

### 4. State Need-Based Grants

Almost every state offers need-based grants for residents attending in-state schools. Here are some of the largest programs:

| State | Program | Maximum Award |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **New York** | Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) | Up to $5,665/year |
| **California** | Cal Grant A & B | Up to $12,630/year |
| **Texas** | TEXAS Grant | Up to $10,000/year |
| **Pennsylvania** | PA State Grant | Up to $5,750/year |
| **Washington** | Washington College Grant | Full tuition for families earning under $78,500 |
| **Minnesota** | Minnesota State Grant | Up to $6,439/year |
| **Illinois** | MAP Grant | Up to $7,044/year |

**How to apply:** In most cases, filing the FAFSA is all you need to do. Some states require a separate application. Check your state's higher education agency website for deadlines — many fall between **February and April**, well before the federal FAFSA deadline.

**Find your state agency:** [nasfaa.org/State_Financial_Aid_Programs](https://www.nasfaa.org/State_Financial_Aid_Programs)

### 5. State "Promise" Programs (Free Community College)

A growing number of states now offer **tuition-free community college** through "Promise" programs. These are last-dollar scholarships that cover whatever tuition remains after your other grants are applied.

**Notable programs include:**

- **Tennessee Promise** — Free tuition at any community college or technical college in the state. Requires community service and a mentor. Apply by November 3 each year.
- **California College Promise Grant** — Waives the $46/unit enrollment fee for eligible students, saving $1,380+ per year. Over 1 million students benefit annually.
- **Oregon Promise** — Covers community college tuition for recent high school graduates.
- **New York Excelsior Scholarship** — Free SUNY/CUNY tuition for families earning under $125,000.
- **Indiana 21st Century Scholars** — Full tuition at any Indiana public college for students who enroll in middle school and maintain requirements.

**Bottom line:** If you're starting at a community college, check whether your state has a Promise program. You may be able to attend for free.

## Institutional Grants: Money From Your Own School

### 6. College and University Need-Based Grants

Here's something most students overlook: **your college itself is often the single largest source of grant money after the federal government.**

Many schools — especially private universities — have massive endowments dedicated to financial aid. Some examples:

- **Harvard** meets 100% of demonstrated financial need; families earning under $85,000 pay nothing
- **Stanford** covers tuition for families earning under $100,000 and tuition plus room and board for families earning under $80,000
- **Community colleges** often have emergency grant funds and institutional aid pools

You don't have to attend an Ivy League school to benefit. Many mid-size state universities and private colleges have their own institutional grant programs funded by alumni donations and endowment earnings.

**How to access:** File the FAFSA. Some private schools also require the **CSS Profile** (available at [cssprofile.collegeboard.org](https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org)), which gives a more detailed picture of your finances. Always check directly with your school's financial aid office.

### 7. Departmental and Major-Specific Grants

Many academic departments have their own grant funding for students in specific programs. Nursing, engineering, education, and social work departments frequently offer grants to attract and retain students. **Ask your department advisor** — these grants are often under-publicized and under-applied-for.

## Grants for Minority Students

Minority students have access to dedicated grant and scholarship programs funded by foundations, corporations, and community organizations. Here are the most significant ones.

## Grants for Women

Women — particularly those in STEM fields and those returning to school as adults — can access several dedicated funding sources.

### 12. P.E.O. Educational Grants

**Amount:** Up to $12,000 (one-time grant)
**Who qualifies:** Women in the U.S. or Canada who are within 24 months of completing a degree or certification
**How to apply:** Must be recommended by a local P.E.O. chapter

P.E.O. (Philanthropic Educational Organization) has been supporting women's education since 1869. Their grants target women who are close to finishing their education but need financial help to cross the finish line. This is particularly valuable for women who went back to school after a gap.

**Website:** [peointernational.org](https://www.peointernational.org)

### 13. Jeannette Rankin Women's Scholarship Fund

**Amount:** Up to $2,000 per year
**Who qualifies:** Women aged 35+ who are pursuing a technical or vocational education, an associate degree, or a first bachelor's degree and meet low-income thresholds

Named after the first woman elected to Congress, this scholarship supports low-income women 35 and older who are working toward economic self-sufficiency through education.

**Website:** [rankinfoundation.org](https://rankinfoundation.org)

### 14. AAUW Selected Professions Fellowships

**Amount:** $5,000 to $20,000

**Website:** [aauw.org/resources/programs/fellowships-grants](https://www.aauw.org/resources/programs/fellowships-grants)

## Grants for First-Generation College Students

If neither of your parents completed a four-year college degree, you're a first-generation student — and you have access to grants designed specifically for students like you.

### 15. Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholarship

**Amount:** Up to $55,000 per year
**Who qualifies:** High-achieving students with demonstrated financial need. Multiple programs available:
- **College Scholarship Program** — for high school seniors
- **Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship** — for community college students transferring to four-year institutions (up to $55,000/year)
**Deadline:** Varies by program (typically November for the College Scholarship)

The Cooke Foundation is one of the most generous scholarship programs in the country. While not exclusively for first-generation students, their focus on financial need means many recipients are first-gen. The Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship is especially valuable for community college students making the jump to a four-year school.

**Website:** [jkcf.org/our-scholarships](https://www.jkcf.org/our-scholarships)

### 16. Dell Scholars Program

**Amount:** $20,000 scholarship + a laptop + textbook credits
**Who qualifies:** Students who participated in an approved college readiness program, demonstrate financial need, and have a minimum 2.4 GPA
**Deadline:** Typically December (annually)

The Dell Scholars Program specifically targets students who have overcome significant obstacles to reach college. Many recipients are first-generation, low-income students. What makes this program unique is the ongoing support — scholars get a dedicated advisor, financial literacy resources, and community throughout college.

**Website:** [dellscholars.org](https://www.dellscholars.org)

## STEM Grants and Scholarships

Students pursuing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees have access to some of the best-funded grant programs in the country.

### 17. National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in STEM (S-STEM)

**Amount:** Varies by institution — often $5,000 to $10,000+ per year
**Who qualifies:** Low-income students pursuing STEM degrees at participating institutions
**How to apply:** Through your college's financial aid or STEM department

NSF funds S-STEM grants at colleges across the country. Your school receives the grant and distributes it to qualifying students. These are need-based, so Pell-eligible students get priority. Check with your school's STEM department to see if they participate.

### 18. Science Ambassador Scholarship

**Amount:** Full tuition (funded by Cards Against Humanity)
**Who qualifies:** Women and non-binary students in STEM fields
**Deadline:** Typically December (annually)

This is one of the most unique STEM scholarships out there. Instead of writing an essay, applicants submit a **3-minute video** explaining a STEM topic they're passionate about. The winner gets full tuition coverage.

**Website:** [scienceambassadorscholarship.org](https://www.scienceambassadorscholarship.org)

## Community College Grants

Community college students often assume they don't qualify for much financial aid. That's wrong. Here are funding sources specifically available to two-year students.

### 19. Federal Pell Grant at Community College

The Pell Grant works at community colleges just like it does at four-year schools. And because community college tuition is lower, **a Pell Grant can often cover your entire tuition and still leave money for books and expenses.**

For example, if you receive the maximum $7,395 Pell Grant and your community college charges $4,000 per year in tuition, you'd have **$3,395 left over** for books, transportation, and supplies. That's effectively getting paid to go to school.

**Starting July 1, 2026:** Pell Grant eligibility is expanding to include very-short-term job training programs (150-599 clock hours / 8-15 weeks). This means career certificates and workforce training programs will qualify for the first time.

### 20. Phi Theta Kappa Scholarships

**Amount:** Varies — typically $1,000 to $10,000, with some transfer scholarships covering full tuition
**Who qualifies:** Members of Phi Theta Kappa, the international honor society for community college students (requires a 3.5+ GPA)
**Deadline:** Varies by scholarship

Phi Theta Kappa administers millions of dollars in scholarships specifically for community college students. Many four-year universities also offer **guaranteed transfer scholarships** for PTK members, making this one of the smartest moves a community college student can make.

## How to Find More Grants: A Step-by-Step Strategy

Knowing these 20 grants is a great start. But there are thousands more out there. Here's how to systematically find every grant you might qualify for.

### Step 1: File the FAFSA First

This is non-negotiable. The FAFSA unlocks federal grants, most state grants, and many institutional grants all at once. File it as early as possible — the 2026-2027 FAFSA opens **October 1, 2025**.

### Step 2: Check Your State's Financial Aid Website

Every state has a higher education agency that lists available grants and scholarships. Google "[your state] + student financial aid" or visit [nasfaa.org/State_Financial_Aid_Programs](https://www.nasfaa.org/State_Financial_Aid_Programs). Pay close attention to state-specific deadlines.

### Step 3: Talk to Your School's Financial Aid Office

This is the most underused resource in higher education. Financial aid counselors know about institutional grants, departmental funds, emergency grants, and outside scholarships. **Schedule an appointment and ask specifically:** "What grants am I not currently receiving that I might qualify for?"

### Step 4: Use Free Scholarship Search Engines

These databases let you filter by demographics, field of study, location, and more:

- **Scholarships.com** — [scholarships.com](https://www.scholarships.com)
- **Fastweb** — [fastweb.com](https://www.fastweb.com)
- **College Board BigFuture** — [bigfuture.collegeboard.org](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org)
- **Bold.org** — [bold.org](https://bold.org)
- **Scholarships360** — [scholarships360.org](https://scholarships360.org)

### Step 5: Check Professional and Community Organizations

Rotary clubs, Elks lodges, churches, unions, employer tuition programs, and local community foundations all offer grants. These smaller, local grants often have **far less competition** than national programs.

### Step 6: Apply to Everything You Qualify For

Grants can be stacked. You can receive a Pell Grant, an FSEOG, a state grant, an institutional grant, and private scholarships **all at the same time**. The more you apply for, the more free money you collect.

**One important note for 2026:** Under new federal rules taking effect July 1, 2026, students who receive non-federal grants or scholarships that cover their full cost of attendance may become ineligible for Pell Grants. This won't affect most students, but it's worth being aware of if you're receiving very large private scholarships.

## Tips for Writing Strong Grant Applications

Finding grants is half the battle. Winning them is the other half. Here's what makes an application stand out.

**Tell your story.** Grant committees want to know who you are, not just what your GPA is. Talk about obstacles you've overcome, what motivates you, and what you plan to do with your education.

**Follow instructions exactly.** If the application asks for a 500-word essay, don't submit 800 words. If it asks for two references, don't send three. Attention to detail matters.

**Apply early.** Many grants are first-come, first-served. Submitting your application on the first day it opens gives you the best shot.

**Proofread everything.** Typos and grammatical errors signal that you didn't take the application seriously. Have someone else read your application before you submit it.

**Keep a spreadsheet.** Track every grant you apply for, including the deadline, required documents, amount, and status. This keeps you organized and prevents missed deadlines.

## Frequently Asked Questions About College Grants

### Do I have to pay grants back?

No. **Grants are free money.** Unlike loans, you never repay them. The one exception is the TEACH Grant, which converts to a loan if you don't complete the required teaching service. All other grants listed in this article are truly free.

### Can I receive multiple grants at the same time?

Yes. You can stack federal grants, state grants, institutional grants, and private grants together. Many students receive four or five different grants simultaneously. The total can't exceed your cost of attendance, but you can combine multiple sources to cover tuition, books, housing, and living expenses.

### What's the difference between a grant and a scholarship?

The terms are often used interchangeably, but there's a general distinction. **Grants** are typically need-based (awarded based on financial need), while **scholarships** are typically merit-based (awarded based on academic achievement, talent, or other criteria). In practice, many programs combine both need and merit factors.

### I'm an adult going back to school. Can I still get grants?

Absolutely. There is **no age limit** for federal financial aid, including the Pell Grant. Many state grants and private grants also serve adult learners. Programs like the Jeannette Rankin Women's Scholarship are specifically designed for adults returning to school.

### What if my parents make too much money?

File the FAFSA anyway. The financial aid formula considers much more than raw income — family size, number of family members in college, medical expenses, and other factors all play a role. Many families earning over $100,000 still qualify for some form of aid. Additionally, many private grants have their own eligibility criteria that may not factor in parental income at all.

### When should I start applying for grants?

**Now.** Seriously — the earlier, the better. For the 2026-2027 school year, the FAFSA opens October 1, 2025. Many state grant deadlines fall in February and March. Private grant deadlines are scattered throughout the year. Create a calendar and start applying as soon as each application opens.

### Are there grants for graduate students?

Yes, though options are more limited than for undergraduates. Graduate students can receive the TEACH Grant (if pursuing teaching), AAUW Fellowships, and many private grants and fellowships. The Pell Grant is currently available only to undergraduates, but graduate students should still file the FAFSA to access other forms of federal aid.
