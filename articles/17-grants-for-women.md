Women start nearly half of all new businesses in the United States. They earn the majority of college degrees. They drive trillions of dollars in consumer spending every year.

And yet — women still receive less than 3% of venture capital funding. They carry roughly two-thirds of all student loan debt. They earn 84 cents for every dollar men earn.

The gap is real. But so is the money available to close it.

**There are billions of dollars in grants, fellowships, and awards specifically for women** — from federal programs that fund women-owned businesses to private foundations that hand out $100,000+ to women entrepreneurs. From education grants that pay for a master's degree to STEM fellowships that cover an entire PhD.

The problem isn't that the money doesn't exist. It's that most women don't know these programs are out there.

This guide covers 12 of the best grant programs for women in 2026. Every program listed is legitimate, currently active, and free to apply for. No fees. No catches.

## Business Grants for Women

### 1. SBA Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contracting Program

The U.S. Small Business Administration doesn't hand out grants directly — but it runs a program that's arguably more valuable. The **WOSB Federal Contracting Program** sets aside billions of dollars in federal contracts exclusively for women-owned small businesses.

The federal government is the largest buyer of goods and services in the world. Through this program, certain contracts are restricted so that only certified women-owned businesses can compete for them.

**Who qualifies:**
- Business must be at least 51% owned and controlled by women
- Women must manage day-to-day operations and make long-term decisions
- Business must be "small" by SBA size standards for your industry
- Must be certified through the SBA's free certification portal or an SBA-approved certifier

**How to apply:** Get certified at [certify.sba.gov](https://certify.sba.gov) and search for contracts at [sam.gov](https://sam.gov).

**Pro tip:** The SBA also funds **Women's Business Centers (WBCs)** in all 50 states. These centers offer free training, mentoring, and help with applying for funding. Find yours at [sba.gov/local-assistance](https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance).

## How to Apply for Grants for Women: Step-by-Step

Getting grant money isn't magic — it's a process. Here's how to give yourself the best shot.

### Step 1: Get Your Documents Ready

Before you apply for anything, gather these essentials:

- **Personal identification** (driver's license, Social Security number)
- **Business registration documents** (if applying for a business grant)
- **Tax returns** (personal and business, typically 2-3 years)
- **Financial statements** (profit & loss, balance sheet, bank statements)
- **Business plan** (even a basic one-page plan helps)
- **Resume or CV** (for education grants and fellowships)
- **Transcripts** (for education grants)
- **Letters of recommendation** (many fellowships require 2-3)

### Step 2: Match Your Situation to the Right Programs

Don't waste time applying for grants you don't qualify for. Ask yourself:

- Am I starting a business, growing one, or going back to school?
- Is my business at least 51% woman-owned?
- Do I qualify based on location, industry, age, or background?
- Can I meet the deadline with a strong application?

### Step 3: Write a Compelling Application

Most grants are competitive. Here's what separates winners from the pile:

- **Be specific about how you'll use the money.** "I'll use $10,000 to purchase equipment for my catering business" beats "I'll use it to grow my business."
- **Tell your story.** Grant reviewers are humans. Why does this matter to you?
- **Show impact.** How many jobs will you create? How many people will benefit?
- **Follow the instructions exactly.** If they ask for a 500-word essay, don't submit 1,000 words.
- **Proofread everything.** Typos signal carelessness.

### Step 4: Apply to Multiple Programs

Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Apply for 5-10 programs simultaneously. The more applications you submit, the better your odds.

### Step 5: Follow Up and Reapply

Didn't get it the first time? Many grant recipients applied 2-3 times before winning. Ask for feedback, improve your application, and try again.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get a grant just for being a woman?

Yes. Many private grants — like the Amber Grant and Cartier Women's Initiative — are open specifically to women with no other restrictions beyond having a business or pursuing education. Government grants typically require meeting income or business criteria, but being a woman gives you access to additional programs.

### Are these grants really free?

The vast majority of legitimate grants are completely free to apply for. The one exception on this list is the Amber Grant, which charges a $15 application fee to fund the grants. **Never pay hundreds of dollars to "apply" for a grant — that's a scam.**

### Can I apply for multiple grants at the same time?

Absolutely. In fact, you should. Grant funding is competitive, and applying to multiple programs increases your chances. Just make sure you're eligible for each one and can submit a quality application.

### Do I need a registered business to apply?

It depends on the grant. Business grants like the Amber Grant and IFundWomen generally require some form of business (even a sole proprietorship). Education grants require enrollment or acceptance into a degree program. Some startup grants are available even if you haven't officially launched yet.

### How long does it take to hear back after applying?

Most grants notify applicants within **2-6 months** after the deadline. Some programs like the Amber Grant announce monthly winners. Larger fellowships like AAUW and Cartier can take 6-9 months.

### What about grant scams?

Be wary of any program that asks for large upfront fees, guarantees you'll win money, contacts you out of the blue, or asks for bank account information before you've been awarded anything. Legitimate grants never guarantee funding and never charge excessive fees. Read our full guide on [how to spot grant scams](https://blog.grantsforme.net/grants-free-money/how-to-spot-grant-scams).

### Are there grants for women starting a business with no experience?

Yes. The Amber Grant and many IFundWomen partner grants have no experience requirements. The SBA's Women's Business Centers also provide free training and mentoring to help first-time entrepreneurs build the skills they need — and then connect them to funding.
