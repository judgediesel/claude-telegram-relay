Housing is the single biggest expense for most American families, and it is only getting more expensive. In 2026, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the United States exceeds $1,500 per month, and in many cities, it is far higher than that. For millions of low-income families, seniors, and people with disabilities, paying rent without help is simply not possible.

That is where **Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers** come in. Administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Section 8 is the largest federal housing assistance program in the country, helping more than **2.3 million households** afford safe, decent housing in the private market.

This guide walks you through everything you need to know about Section 8 in 2026 -- who qualifies, how much assistance you can get, how to apply, what the waitlist looks like, and how to maximize your chances of getting a voucher.

## What Is the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program?

Section 8, officially known as the **Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program**, is a federal rental assistance program that helps low-income families, elderly individuals, and people with disabilities afford housing in the private rental market.

Unlike public housing where you live in a government-owned building, Section 8 gives you a **voucher** that you can use to rent **any qualifying unit** from a private landlord -- an apartment, townhouse, single-family home, or even a mobile home. The government pays a portion of your rent directly to the landlord, and you pay the rest.

### How Section 8 Works in Practice

Here is the basic structure:

1. You are approved for a voucher through your local **Public Housing Authority (PHA)**
2. The PHA determines your **portion of rent** based on your income (generally **30% of your adjusted gross income**)
3. You find a rental unit that meets **HUD quality standards** and is within the **payment standard** for your area
4. The PHA inspects the unit and approves the lease
5. The PHA pays the landlord the difference between your share and the total rent
6. You pay your share directly to the landlord each month

**Example:** Your household income is $20,000 per year. Your share of rent would be approximately $500 per month (30% of income). If the approved rent for your unit is $1,400 per month, the PHA pays the landlord $900 and you pay $500.

## Section 8 Eligibility Requirements

### Income Limits

Section 8 eligibility is primarily based on income. HUD sets income limits for each metropolitan area and county in the country, broken into three categories:

- **Extremely Low Income (ELI):** 30% of Area Median Income (AMI) or less
- **Very Low Income (VLI):** 50% of AMI or less
- **Low Income:** 80% of AMI or less

By law, PHAs must provide **75% of their vouchers** to families at the **extremely low income** level (30% AMI or below). The remaining 25% can go to families earning up to 50% of AMI. In practice, the vast majority of Section 8 recipients earn well below 50% AMI.

### 2026 Income Limits by Example Areas

Income limits vary significantly by location. Here are examples for a family of four:

| Metropolitan Area | Extremely Low (30% AMI) | Very Low (50% AMI) | Low Income (80% AMI) |
|---|---|---|---|
| New York City, NY | $32,800 | $54,700 | $87,500 |
| Los Angeles, CA | $31,750 | $52,900 | $84,650 |
| Houston, TX | $25,750 | $42,900 | $68,650 |
| Chicago, IL | $28,500 | $47,500 | $76,000 |
| Phoenix, AZ | $25,500 | $42,500 | $68,000 |
| Philadelphia, PA | $27,900 | $46,500 | $74,350 |
| Miami, FL | $26,150 | $43,550 | $69,700 |
| Atlanta, GA | $27,200 | $45,350 | $72,550 |
| Denver, CO | $31,250 | $52,100 | $83,350 |
| National Median | $25,500 | $42,500 | $68,000 |

*These are approximate figures for 2026. Actual limits are updated annually by HUD. Look up your specific area at [huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html).*

### Income Limits by Household Size

Income limits also adjust for household size. As a general rule, here is how the 2026 national median income limits break down:

| Household Size | Extremely Low (30% AMI) | Very Low (50% AMI) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 person | $17,850 | $29,750 |
| 2 people | $20,400 | $34,000 |
| 3 people | $22,950 | $38,250 |
| 4 people | $25,500 | $42,500 |
| 5 people | $27,550 | $45,900 |
| 6 people | $29,600 | $49,300 |

### Other Eligibility Requirements

Beyond income, you must also meet these criteria:

- **Citizenship or eligible immigration status:** At least one household member must be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or have eligible immigration status. Mixed-status families can receive prorated assistance.
- **Background check:** PHAs conduct criminal background checks. While policies vary, conviction for manufacturing methamphetamine in federally assisted housing or being a registered lifetime sex offender will disqualify you nationwide. Other criminal history is evaluated on a case-by-case basis by each PHA.
- **Eviction history:** Recent evictions from federally assisted housing may disqualify you.
- **References:** Some PHAs require landlord references.
- **Social Security numbers:** All household members must provide Social Security numbers (or certify that they do not have one).

## How Much Does Section 8 Pay?

### Your Share: The 30% Rule

As a general rule, Section 8 participants pay **30% of their adjusted monthly income** toward rent. Adjusted income is your gross income minus certain deductions HUD allows, including:

- **$480 per dependent** (children under 18 or full-time students)
- **$400 per elderly or disabled family**
- **Childcare expenses** for children under 13 (if you are working or going to school)
- **Disability-related expenses** not reimbursed by insurance
- **Medical expenses exceeding 3% of income** (for elderly or disabled families)

**Example calculation:**

- Gross annual income: $24,000
- One child under 18: -$480
- Adjusted income: $23,520
- Monthly adjusted income: $1,960
- Your rent share (30%): **$588 per month**

### Payment Standards: What the Voucher Covers

Each PHA sets a **payment standard** based on HUD's **Fair Market Rent (FMR)** for the area. The payment standard represents the maximum amount the PHA will subsidize for a given unit size.

**2026 Fair Market Rents (select cities, 2-bedroom):**

| City | Fair Market Rent (2BR) |
|---|---|
| New York City, NY | $2,387 |
| San Francisco, CA | $2,926 |
| Los Angeles, CA | $2,182 |
| Boston, MA | $2,335 |
| Miami, FL | $1,915 |
| Houston, TX | $1,289 |
| Chicago, IL | $1,378 |
| Phoenix, AZ | $1,432 |
| Atlanta, GA | $1,467 |
| Dallas, TX | $1,467 |

*FMRs are updated annually. Look up your area at [huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html).*

### Voucher Bedroom Size

The size of your voucher (number of bedrooms) is determined by family composition:

| Household Members | Voucher Size |
|---|---|
| 1 person | 0 or 1 bedroom |
| 2 people | 1 bedroom |
| 3-4 people | 2 bedrooms |
| 5-6 people | 3 bedrooms |
| 7-8 people | 4 bedrooms |

You can rent a unit that is **larger** than your voucher size, but you will pay the difference between the payment standard for your voucher size and the actual rent. You can also rent a **smaller** unit to save money.

## How to Apply for Section 8

### Step 1: Find Your Local Public Housing Authority

Section 8 is administered locally by approximately **3,300 PHAs** across the country. Your first step is to find the PHA that serves your area.

- **Online:** Use HUD's PHA search tool at [hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts)
- **By phone:** Call HUD's Resource Center at **1-800-955-2232**
- **In person:** Visit your local HUD office

### Step 2: Check If the Waitlist Is Open

This is the critical step that trips most people up. Unlike programs like SNAP or Medicaid where you can apply anytime, **Section 8 waitlists are only open during specific enrollment periods** -- and many are closed for years at a time.

When a PHA opens its waitlist, it typically:

- Announces it on its website, through local media, and at community organizations
- Opens for a **limited window** (sometimes as short as one week)
- May accept applications online, by mail, or in person
- May use a **lottery system** to select which applicants are placed on the waitlist

**How to find open waitlists:**

- Check [affordablehousingonline.com](https://www.affordablehousingonline.com/open-section-8-waiting-lists) for a current list of open Section 8 waitlists nationwide
- Sign up for email alerts from your local PHA
- Call your PHA periodically to ask about waitlist openings
- **Apply to multiple PHAs.** You are not limited to one application. Apply everywhere you are willing to live.

### Step 3: Complete the Application

When the waitlist is open, you will need to submit an application that includes:

- **Personal information** for all household members (names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers)
- **Income information** (pay stubs, tax returns, Social Security benefit statements, child support records)
- **Asset information** (bank statements, property ownership)
- **Current housing situation** (current address, landlord information, rent amount)
- **Preferences** (many PHAs give preference to certain groups -- see below)

### Step 4: Wait (and Keep Your Information Updated)

After applying, you will be placed on a **waitlist** and assigned a position based on your application date, any preferences you qualify for, and sometimes a random lottery number.

**Average waitlist times vary enormously:**

| Location Type | Typical Waitlist Time |
|---|---|
| Large cities (NYC, LA, Chicago) | 5-10+ years |
| Mid-size cities | 2-5 years |
| Suburban areas | 1-3 years |
| Rural areas | 6 months - 2 years |
| Some small towns | Immediately to 6 months |

While you are on the waitlist, you **must** keep your contact information updated with the PHA. If they try to reach you and cannot, you will be removed from the list.

### Step 5: Attend Your Eligibility Interview

When your name reaches the top of the list, the PHA will contact you for an **eligibility interview**. You will need to provide:

- Photo identification for all adults
- Birth certificates for all household members
- Social Security cards for all household members
- Proof of all income sources
- Bank statements (typically last 3 months)
- Verification of any deductions (disability documentation, childcare expenses, etc.)

The PHA will verify your information, conduct background checks, and determine your eligibility. If approved, you will receive your voucher.

## How to Maximize Your Chances of Getting a Voucher

### Apply to Multiple PHAs

There is no rule that says you can only apply to one waitlist. Apply to **every PHA in your region** -- and consider applying to PHAs in areas where you would be willing to relocate. Smaller cities and rural areas often have shorter waitlists.

### Know Your Preferences

Most PHAs give **preference** to certain applicants, which moves them higher on the waitlist. Common preferences include:

- **Homeless or at risk of homelessness**
- **Living in substandard housing**
- **Involuntarily displaced** (evicted through no fault of your own, fleeing domestic violence, etc.)
- **Veterans or military families**
- **Elderly (62+) or disabled**
- **Families with children**
- **Currently paying more than 50% of income for rent**
- **Working families** (employed or enrolled in education/training)

If you qualify for any preferences, make sure to document them clearly on your application.

### Explore Special Voucher Programs

In addition to the standard Housing Choice Voucher, several specialized voucher programs exist with separate waitlists and funding:

- **HUD-VASH (Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing):** Combines a Section 8 voucher with VA case management and support services. Available exclusively to homeless veterans. Contact your local VA Medical Center.
- **Family Unification Program (FUP):** Provides vouchers to families involved with child welfare services when lack of housing is a factor, and to youth aging out of foster care (ages 18-24).
- **Mainstream Vouchers:** Specifically for non-elderly people with disabilities. These have a separate waitlist and are sometimes easier to obtain.
- **Emergency Housing Vouchers (EHV):** Authorized in 2021 for people who are homeless, at risk of homelessness, fleeing domestic violence, or recently homeless. Many PHAs still have EHVs available.
- **Project-Based Vouchers (PBV):** Attached to specific properties rather than portable. You apply through the property management, not the PHA waitlist.
- **Tenant Protection Vouchers:** Issued when public housing is demolished or converted, or when project-based contracts end. These protect current residents.

## After You Get Your Voucher: Finding a Unit

Once you receive your voucher, you typically have **60 to 120 days** to find a qualifying rental unit. Some PHAs allow extensions, but do not count on it.

### What Landlords Must Accept

In some states and cities, landlords are **required by law** to accept Section 8 vouchers and cannot discriminate against voucher holders. As of 2026, jurisdictions with **source of income protection** laws include:

- **States:** California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin
- **Cities:** Austin TX, Chicago IL, Dallas TX, Kansas City MO, New Orleans LA, Philadelphia PA, Pittsburgh PA, San Antonio TX, Seattle WA, and many others

If your state does not have such protections, landlords can legally refuse to accept your voucher.

### Tips for Finding a Section 8 Landlord

1. **Use HUD's affordable housing search** at [hud.gov](https://www.hud.gov) or [goSection8.com](https://www.gosection8.com) to find landlords who accept vouchers.
2. **Contact your PHA.** Many PHAs maintain lists of landlord partners.
3. **Look for "Section 8 Welcome" listings** on Zillow, Apartments.com, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace.
4. **Attend PHA housing fairs** where landlords come to recruit voucher holders.
5. **Be a strong applicant.** Have references ready, present yourself professionally, and be upfront about your voucher.
6. **Ask your PHA about portability.** Your voucher can be used in any area where a PHA administers the program -- you are not limited to the PHA that issued your voucher.

### The Inspection Process

Before your lease is approved, the PHA must inspect the unit to ensure it meets **Housing Quality Standards (HQS)**. The inspection checks for:

- Working plumbing, heating, and electrical systems
- Adequate space (minimum square footage per bedroom)
- No lead-based paint hazards (especially for families with children under 6)
- Working smoke detectors
- Secure locks on doors and windows
- No pest infestations
- Overall structural soundness

If the unit fails inspection, the landlord must make repairs before the PHA will approve the lease. If repairs are not made, you will need to find another unit.

## Maintaining Your Section 8 Voucher

Getting a voucher is hard enough -- do not lose it. Here is what you need to know about keeping your benefits:

### Annual Recertification

Each year, the PHA will recertify your eligibility. You must:

- Report all household income and changes
- Provide updated documentation
- Attend a recertification interview (in person or by mail/online, depending on your PHA)

### Report Changes Promptly

You must notify your PHA within **10 to 30 days** (varies by PHA) of any changes to:

- Household income (job loss, raise, new job)
- Household composition (someone moves in or out, birth of a child, death)
- Contact information

Failure to report changes can result in termination of your voucher.

### What Can Get Your Voucher Terminated

- **Fraud** (misrepresenting income, household members, or other information)
- **Criminal activity** by any household member
- **Lease violations** (damage to property, disturbing neighbors, unauthorized occupants)
- **Non-payment of your rent share**
- **Failure to recertify**
- **Absence from your unit** for more than an extended period (typically 180 days or more)

## Section 8 for Landlords: What Owners Need to Know

If you are a landlord considering accepting Section 8 tenants, here are the key facts:

### Benefits for Landlords

- **Guaranteed partial rent.** The PHA portion of rent is paid directly to you every month, on time.
- **Reduced vacancy.** Voucher holders are motivated tenants with a financial incentive to keep their housing.
- **Larger tenant pool.** In tight rental markets, accepting vouchers expands your pool of potential renters.
- **Fair market rent.** The PHA pays based on FMR, which reflects market conditions in your area.

### Landlord Requirements

- Your unit must **pass an HQS inspection** before the lease begins and at annual reinspections.
- You must **maintain the unit** in compliance with HQS throughout the lease.
- You cannot charge the tenant more than a **reasonable rent** as determined by the PHA.
- You must sign a **Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contract** with the PHA.
- You can still screen tenants using your normal criteria (credit, references, rental history) in addition to the voucher.

### How to Start Accepting Section 8

1. Contact your local PHA and express interest in becoming a Section 8 landlord
2. List your property on [goSection8.com](https://www.gosection8.com) and note "Section 8 accepted" on other listing sites
3. Prepare your unit to pass HQS inspection
4. Set your rent at or below the payment standard for your area

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to get Section 8?

Waitlist times range from a few months in rural areas to over 10 years in major cities. The national average is approximately 2 to 3 years, but it varies enormously by location.

### Can I transfer my Section 8 voucher to another state?

Yes. Section 8 vouchers are **portable**. You can move to any area in the country where a PHA operates the voucher program. You will need to notify your current PHA at least 30 days before your planned move, and the receiving PHA will take over administration of your voucher.

### What happens if my income increases after I get Section 8?

Your rent share will increase proportionally (you still pay 30% of adjusted income). If your income rises above the eligibility limit, the PHA may give you a grace period or gradually increase your share. In some cases, your voucher may be terminated if your income exceeds the limit for an extended period, but the PHA must give you advance notice.

### Can single people without children get Section 8?

Yes. Any individual or family that meets the income requirements can apply. However, families with children, elderly individuals, and people with disabilities often receive preference on waitlists.

### Can I use Section 8 to buy a house?

Yes. HUD offers the **Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program**, which allows qualifying voucher holders to use their monthly voucher payment toward a mortgage instead of rent. You must be a first-time homebuyer, employed (unless elderly or disabled), and complete a homeownership counseling program. Contact your PHA to see if they participate in this option.

### Does Section 8 cover utilities?

Not directly. However, the PHA includes a **utility allowance** in its payment standard calculation. If your utilities are not included in your rent, the utility allowance effectively reduces your share of rent, giving you extra money to cover utilities. In some cases, the utility allowance may even result in a direct payment to you.
