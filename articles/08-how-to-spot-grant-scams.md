Every year, thousands of Americans lose money to grant scams. The Federal Trade Commission reports that **imposter scams — including fake grant offers — cost victims over $2.7 billion in a single year.** The average person who falls for a grant scam loses between $500 and $3,000. Some lose much more.

These scams work because they target people who genuinely need help. If you're struggling to pay bills, keep up with rent, or fund your education, a phone call or message promising "free government money" can sound like an answer to your prayers.

But here's the truth: **the government will never call you out of the blue to offer you a grant.** Real grants don't work that way.

This guide will show you exactly how to spot grant scams, what to do if you've already been targeted, and where to find legitimate grant programs you can actually trust.

## Why Grant Scams Are So Common

Grant scams are everywhere because they exploit a simple fact — real government grants do exist. That makes the lie easy to sell.

Scammers know that millions of Americans are looking for financial help. They use that desperation to create convincing pitches that sound official. They mention real agencies. They use professional-sounding language. They create websites that look like government portals.

And they've gotten smarter. Scams now show up on:

- **Phone calls** and robocalls
- **Text messages** and WhatsApp
- **Facebook and Instagram ads**
- **Emails** that look like they're from a government agency
- **Fake websites** with .org or .us domains (designed to look like .gov sites)

The more you know about how these scams operate, the better you can protect yourself and the people you care about.

## 10 Red Flags of a Grant Scam

If you see any of these warning signs, you're almost certainly dealing with a scam.

### 1. They Ask You to Pay a Fee

This is the biggest red flag. **Legitimate government grants never require an upfront fee.** If someone asks you to pay a "processing fee," "application fee," "tax," or "deposit" to receive your grant money — it's a scam. Period.

### 2. You Didn't Apply for Anything

Real grants don't fall out of the sky. If you receive a call, text, email, or social media message saying you've been "selected" for a grant you never applied for — someone is trying to steal your money.

### 3. They Guarantee You'll Be Approved

No one can guarantee grant approval. Every legitimate grant program has eligibility requirements, an application process, and limited funding. **Anyone who promises you'll definitely receive money is lying.**

### 4. They Pressure You to Act Immediately

Scammers create fake urgency. They'll say things like "this offer expires today" or "you'll lose your spot if you don't act now." Real government programs don't pressure you. They give you time to review, research, and apply at your own pace.

### 5. They Ask for Your Bank Account Information

A real grant agency will never ask for your bank account number, debit card, or credit card number over the phone or in a text message. If someone says they need your banking info to "deposit the grant funds," they're setting you up to drain your account.

### 6. They Ask for Your Social Security Number Upfront

While some legitimate applications eventually require your SSN (like FAFSA for student grants), no one will ask for it during an unsolicited phone call or text. **Never give your Social Security number to someone who contacts you out of the blue.**

### 7. They Want Payment by Gift Card, Wire Transfer, or Cryptocurrency

This is a dead giveaway. Legitimate government agencies accept none of these as payment — because they don't charge you anything. Scammers prefer gift cards, wire transfers, and crypto because **those payments are nearly impossible to trace or reverse.**

### 8. The Website Doesn't End in .gov

Official federal government websites always end in **.gov**. If you're directed to a website that ends in .com, .org, .net, or .us — and it claims to be a government site — be very suspicious. Check the URL carefully. Scammers often create domains like "us-government-grants.org" to fool you.

### 9. They Claim to Be From a Government Agency but Can't Prove It

If someone calls saying they're from the "Federal Grant Administration" or the "U.S. Grant Department," know this — those agencies don't exist. Real agencies include the SBA, HUD, the Department of Education, and others. You can always hang up and call the real agency directly using the number on their official .gov website.

### 10. They Contact You Through Social Media

Government agencies do not award grants through Facebook messages, Instagram DMs, or comments on social media posts. If someone contacts you on social media claiming you've won a grant, block and report them immediately.

## How Grant Scams Actually Work: Real Examples

Understanding how these scams play out in real life can help you recognize them before you become a victim.

### The Phone Call Scam

You get a call from someone who says they're from a "government grant office." They congratulate you on being selected for a $9,000 grant. All you need to do is pay a $250 "processing fee" to release the funds. They ask you to buy a gift card and read them the numbers on the back. Once you do, the money is gone — and the grant never existed.

**How to spot it:** The government doesn't call people to award grants. No real grant requires a fee. No legitimate organization accepts gift cards as payment.

### The Facebook Ad Scam

You see an ad on Facebook that says: "Apply for your free government grant — $5,000 to $25,000, no credit check!" You click the link and land on a professional-looking website. You fill out a form with your name, address, phone number, and Social Security number. Then you're told to pay a $99 "application processing fee" with a credit card.

**What really happened:** You just handed over your personal information and paid for nothing. Your identity is now at risk, and your credit card may be charged again.

### The Email or Text Scam

You receive an email that looks like it's from a government agency. The subject line says: "You've been approved for a federal grant." The email includes a link to "claim your funds." When you click, you're taken to a form asking for your bank routing number so they can "deposit the money directly."

**What really happened:** There's no grant. The scammer now has your banking information and can withdraw money from your account or sell your info on the dark web.

## How to Verify If a Grant Is Legitimate

Before you share any personal information or get your hopes up, here's how to check whether a grant offer is real.

### Check Official Government Websites

The only trustworthy source for federal grants is **[Grants.gov](https://www.grants.gov)**. For benefits and assistance programs, check **[Benefits.gov](https://www.benefits.gov)** and **[USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov)**. If a grant isn't listed on these sites, it's almost certainly not real.

### Call the Agency Directly

If someone claims to be from a specific government agency, **look up that agency's phone number yourself** — don't use any number the caller gives you. Call the agency and ask whether the grant program exists and whether they contacted you.

### Search the FTC Scam Database

The Federal Trade Commission tracks reported scams. Visit **[ReportFraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov)** to search for the company name or phone number that contacted you. If others have reported it, you'll find it there.

### Research the Organization

If a private organization claims to offer a grant, look them up. Check the **[Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org)**, search their name along with the word "scam," and see what comes up. Legitimate organizations have a track record, reviews, and verifiable contact information.

### Trust Your Instincts

If something feels too good to be true, it almost always is. Free money doesn't come with fees, pressure, or secrecy. If any part of the interaction makes you uncomfortable, walk away.

## What to Do If You've Already Been Scammed

If you've fallen for a grant scam, don't panic — and don't be embarrassed. These scams are designed to fool smart people. Here's what to do right away.

### 1. Report It to the FTC

File a complaint at **[ReportFraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov)**. This helps the FTC track scam patterns and take action against criminals.

### 2. Contact Your Bank Immediately

If you gave out your bank account or credit card information, call your bank right away. Ask them to:

- **Freeze your account** to stop unauthorized transactions
- **Reverse any fraudulent charges** if possible
- **Issue a new card or account number**

### 3. Freeze Your Credit

If you shared your Social Security number, place a **credit freeze** with all three credit bureaus:

- **Equifax:** [equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services)
- **Experian:** [experian.com/freeze](https://www.experian.com/freeze)
- **TransUnion:** [transunion.com/credit-freeze](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze)

A credit freeze is free and prevents scammers from opening new accounts in your name.

### 4. Report to Your State Attorney General

Every state has an attorney general's office that handles consumer fraud. Find yours at **[naag.org](https://www.naag.org)**.

### 5. Change Your Passwords

If you clicked any suspicious links or entered login information, change your passwords immediately — especially for your email, bank accounts, and any accounts that share the same password.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will the government ever call me about a grant?

No. The federal government does not make unsolicited phone calls to offer grants. If someone calls you claiming to be from a government agency and offering free grant money, it is a scam. Hang up immediately. Real grants require you to find them and apply on your own through official channels like Grants.gov.

### Is there really such a thing as a free government grant?

Yes — real government grants absolutely exist. The federal government distributes hundreds of billions of dollars in grants each year for education, housing, small business, and more. The key difference is that legitimate grants never ask you to pay a fee, and you have to apply for them through official government websites. Check our guide on [how to apply for government grants](/how-to-apply-for-government-grants) for step-by-step instructions.

### What should I do if I paid money to a grant scammer?

Act quickly. Contact your bank or credit card company to try to reverse the charge. If you paid with a gift card, contact the gift card company (though recovery is unlikely). File a report with the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. If you shared personal information like your Social Security number, freeze your credit with Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion right away.

### How can I tell if a grant website is legitimate?

Official federal government websites always end in .gov. If the site ends in .com, .org, .net, or .us and claims to be a government site, it's likely a scam. Also check whether the grant program is listed on Grants.gov or Benefits.gov. Legitimate private grants will come from well-known organizations with verifiable track records, public contact information, and no upfront fees.

### Are grants on social media real?

Almost never. The vast majority of "grant offers" you see on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or WhatsApp are scams. Government agencies do not distribute grants through social media. If you see a post or ad claiming you can get free grant money by messaging someone or clicking a link, do not engage. Report the post and move on.
