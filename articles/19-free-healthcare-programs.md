## Medicaid: Free Health Insurance for Low-Income Americans

Medicaid is the single largest source of free health coverage in the country. It is a joint federal-state program that provides comprehensive medical insurance to people with low incomes, and it covers everything from doctor visits and hospital stays to prescriptions, lab work, and preventive care.

### Who Qualifies for Medicaid in 2026?

Eligibility depends on your state, your income, your household size, and your situation (pregnant, disabled, parent, etc.). In the **40 states plus D.C. that expanded Medicaid**, most adults with incomes up to **138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)** qualify. For 2026, that means:

| Household Size | 138% FPL (Annual Income) |
|---|---|
| 1 person | $22,024 |
| 2 people | $29,862 |
| 3 people | $37,702 |
| 4 people | $45,540 |

In **non-expansion states** (like Texas, Florida, Georgia, and others), eligibility is more restrictive and often limited to pregnant women, children, people with disabilities, and very low-income parents.

### How to Apply for Medicaid

1. **Online:** Visit [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov) or your state's Medicaid website
2. **By phone:** Call the Marketplace at **1-800-318-2596** (TTY: 1-855-889-4325)
3. **In person:** Visit your local Department of Social Services or Medicaid office
4. **By mail:** Request a paper application from your state Medicaid agency

**What you will need:** Proof of identity, Social Security numbers for household members, proof of income (pay stubs, tax returns), and proof of residency.

Most states process Medicaid applications within **45 days** (90 days for disability-based applications). If you are eligible, **coverage can be retroactive up to 3 months** before your application date.

## CHIP: Free or Low-Cost Insurance for Children

The **Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)** covers children in families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private insurance. CHIP covers doctor visits, immunizations, hospital care, dental and vision care, prescriptions, and more.

### CHIP Eligibility in 2026

Income limits vary by state but generally cover children in families earning up to **200% to 300% of FPL** -- and some states go as high as **400% FPL**. For a family of four, that could mean qualifying with a household income up to $66,000 or more depending on your state.

- **Premiums:** Many states offer CHIP at no cost. Others charge small monthly premiums (typically $0 to $50/month)
- **Copays:** Minimal or none for most services
- **Age:** Covers children up to age 19

### How to Apply for CHIP

1. Visit [InsureKidsNow.gov](https://www.insurekidsnow.gov) or call **1-877-543-7669**
2. Apply through [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov) -- your application will automatically be screened for both Medicaid and CHIP
3. Contact your state's CHIP program directly

**Do not assume your family earns too much.** Many middle-income families are surprised to find their children qualify.

## ACA Marketplace Subsidies: Affordable Insurance Through the Health Exchange

Even if you do not qualify for Medicaid or CHIP, the **Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace** offers subsidized health insurance that can dramatically reduce your monthly premiums.

### What You Need to Know for 2026

The enhanced premium tax credits that were in place from 2021 through 2025 expired at the end of 2025. However, in January 2026, the **U.S. House of Representatives voted to extend enhanced ACA subsidies for three years**. Check [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov) for the latest status on subsidy levels.

Under the standard ACA rules that remain in effect:

- **Premium tax credits** are available to individuals and families earning between **100% and 400% of FPL**
- For a single person, that is roughly **$15,960 to $63,840** in annual income
- For a family of four, that is roughly **$33,000 to $132,000**
- Subsidies are calculated on a sliding scale -- the less you earn, the more help you get

### How to Enroll

1. Visit [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov) during Open Enrollment (typically November through January)
2. **Special Enrollment:** You can enroll outside open enrollment if you have a qualifying life event (job loss, marriage, birth of a child, loss of other coverage, or moving)
3. Use the [Marketplace savings estimator](https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/) to check what you would pay
4. Free help is available from certified **navigators** and **enrollment assisters** -- find one at [LocalHelp.HealthCare.gov](https://localhelp.healthcare.gov)

## Community Health Centers (FQHCs): Care on a Sliding Scale

### How FQHCs Work

- They offer **primary care, dental care, mental health services, and prescriptions**
- Fees are based on a **sliding scale** tied to your income and family size
- If your income is at or below **100% of FPL**, you may pay **nothing or a nominal fee**
- If your income is at or below **200% of FPL**, you receive discounted care
- **You cannot be turned away** for inability to pay

### How to Find a Community Health Center

1. Visit [FindAHealthCenter.HRSA.gov](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov)
2. Enter your address or zip code
3. Call the center nearest you and ask about their sliding fee program

Community health centers serve approximately **30 million patients** each year. If you do not have insurance, this should be one of the first places you call.

## Hospital Financial Assistance: The Hill-Burton Program and Charity Care

### Hill-Burton Free and Reduced-Cost Care

Under the **Hill-Burton Act**, certain hospitals and healthcare facilities are legally obligated to provide free or reduced-cost care to patients who cannot pay. About **127 facilities nationwide** still carry this obligation.

**Eligibility:**
- **Free care:** Income at or below **100% of FPL** ($15,960/year for a single person)
- **Reduced-cost care:** Income up to **200% of FPL** (up to **300% of FPL** for nursing home care)

1. Search for obligated facilities at [HRSA.gov/get-health-care/affordable/hill-burton](https://www.hrsa.gov/get-health-care/affordable/hill-burton)
2. Ask the hospital's admissions or billing office about Hill-Burton eligibility

### Nonprofit Hospital Charity Care

Under the ACA, **all nonprofit hospitals** (which make up about 57% of U.S. hospitals) are required to have a **Financial Assistance Policy (FAP)**. This means they must:

- Offer free or discounted care to eligible patients
- Publicize their financial assistance policies
- Not use aggressive collection tactics against patients who qualify

**Action step:** If you receive a hospital bill you cannot pay, **always call the billing department and ask about financial assistance before paying anything**. Many hospitals will reduce or eliminate bills for patients under 200% to 400% of FPL.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get free healthcare if I have no income?

Yes. If you have no income, you almost certainly qualify for **Medicaid** in expansion states. Even in non-expansion states, community health centers are required to see you regardless of ability to pay, and free clinics provide no-cost care. Apply for Medicaid first, then contact your nearest FQHC.

### What if I make too much for Medicaid but cannot afford insurance?

Check the **ACA Marketplace** for subsidized plans -- many people qualify for significant premium reductions. Also use community health centers (which offer sliding-scale fees up to 200% FPL) and look into prescription assistance programs for medication costs.

### Can I get help with medical bills I have already received?

Yes. **Nonprofit hospitals are required to offer financial assistance programs.** Contact the hospital billing department and ask about charity care or financial assistance. You can also apply for Hill-Burton assistance even after a bill has gone to collections. Many hospitals will reduce bills by 50% or more for qualifying patients.

### Does immigration status affect eligibility?

**Medicaid** generally requires U.S. citizenship or qualifying immigration status, but **emergency Medicaid** covers emergency room treatment regardless of status. Community health centers and free clinics serve everyone regardless of immigration status. Several states (including California and Illinois) have expanded coverage to undocumented residents.

### How do I get free prescription drugs?

Start with [NeedyMeds.org](https://www.needymeds.org) to search for patient assistance programs by drug name. Most major pharmaceutical companies offer free medications through their PAPs. You can also use [GoodRx.com](https://www.goodrx.com) for immediate discounts of up to 80% at your local pharmacy with no application required.
