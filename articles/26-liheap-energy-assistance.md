When your electric bill arrives and the number makes your stomach drop, you're not alone. Roughly one in three American households struggles to pay their energy bills, and that number climbs every year as utility costs rise faster than wages. If you've ever had to choose between keeping the lights on and buying groceries — or faced a shutoff notice taped to your front door — there's a federal program designed specifically for this situation. It's called LIHEAP, and it helps millions of families across the country pay their heating and cooling bills every year.

The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is one of the most underutilized government programs in America. Billions of dollars in funding are available annually, yet many eligible families never apply because they don't know the program exists. This guide covers everything you need to know: what LIHEAP pays for, who qualifies, how to apply, and what to do if LIHEAP isn't enough to cover your energy costs.

## What Is LIHEAP?

LIHEAP — the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program — is a federally funded program that helps low-income households pay for home energy costs. Congress established LIHEAP in 1981, and it's administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through the Administration for Children and Families (ACF).

The federal government distributes LIHEAP funds to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and tribal organizations. Each state then designs and runs its own LIHEAP program, which means eligibility requirements, benefit amounts, and application procedures vary depending on where you live.

### What Does LIHEAP Cover?

LIHEAP provides four main types of assistance:

#### 1. Heating Assistance

The most common form of LIHEAP help. This provides a direct payment toward your heating costs during the cold months — whether you heat with natural gas, electricity, propane, oil, wood, or kerosene. The payment typically goes directly to your utility company or fuel vendor, not to you.

#### 2. Cooling Assistance

Many states also offer help with summer cooling costs, especially in hot-weather states. This covers electricity for air conditioning or may provide fans or air conditioning units to qualifying households.

#### 3. Crisis Assistance (Emergency Help)

If you're facing an energy emergency — a shutoff notice, a broken heating system in winter, or a dangerous situation related to your home energy — LIHEAP crisis assistance can provide emergency funds to prevent disconnection or restore service. Crisis assistance often has **faster processing times** than regular LIHEAP.

#### 4. Weatherization Assistance

Some LIHEAP funds go toward making your home more energy-efficient — insulation, weather stripping, furnace repair or replacement, and other improvements that reduce your energy bills long-term. This is sometimes handled through the separate **Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)**, which is funded by the Department of Energy.

### How Much Does LIHEAP Pay?

Benefit amounts vary significantly based on your state, household size, income, energy costs, and the type of fuel you use. Here are general ranges:

- **Heating assistance:** Typically $200–$1,000+ per heating season (national average around $400–$500)
- **Cooling assistance:** Typically $100–$600 per cooling season
- **Crisis assistance:** Can range from $200 to $2,000+ depending on the emergency and state
- **Weatherization:** Can be worth thousands of dollars in home improvements

**Important:** LIHEAP is not meant to pay your entire energy bill. It's designed to offset a portion of your costs, making your bills more manageable. Some states calculate benefits based on a percentage of your energy burden (the share of your income that goes to energy costs), while others use flat amounts based on income and household size.

## Who Qualifies for LIHEAP?

### Income Eligibility

Each state sets its own income limits, but federal law requires that states use one of the following thresholds (or a state-set level in between):

- **150% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)** — the minimum threshold states must use
- **60% of the State Median Income (SMI)** — the maximum threshold states can use

Most states set their eligibility somewhere between these two benchmarks. Here are the 2026 income limits at 150% FPL:

| Household Size | Annual Income (150% FPL) | Monthly Income |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | $22,590 | $1,883 |
| 2 | $30,660 | $2,555 |
| 3 | $38,730 | $3,228 |
| 4 | $46,800 | $3,900 |
| 5 | $54,870 | $4,573 |
| 6 | $62,940 | $5,245 |
| 7 | $71,010 | $5,918 |
| 8 | $79,080 | $6,590 |

**In many states, the actual income limit is higher than these numbers** because states that use the State Median Income threshold allow significantly higher incomes. For example, in states like Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York, a family of four might qualify with income up to $65,000–$75,000 per year.

### Automatic/Categorical Eligibility

In many states, you automatically qualify for LIHEAP if any household member receives:

- **SNAP (food stamps)**
- **SSI (Supplemental Security Income)**
- **TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families)**
- **Certain veterans' benefits**

If you already receive any of these benefits, don't assume you need to meet a separate income test for LIHEAP — you may already be pre-qualified.

### Other Eligibility Requirements

- **Residency:** You must live in the state where you apply
- **Citizenship:** U.S. citizens and certain qualified non-citizens (legal permanent residents, refugees, asylees) are eligible
- **Energy costs:** You must be responsible for paying your home energy costs — either directly to a utility company or indirectly through rent that includes utilities
- **Renters qualify:** You do not need to own your home. If your rent includes utilities, you can still apply — the benefit may come to you as a direct payment or credit

### Priority Groups

LIHEAP gives priority to households with the **highest energy costs relative to income** and those that include:

- **Elderly members** (age 60+)
- **Disabled members**
- **Young children** (under age 6)

If your household includes someone in these priority groups, your application may be processed faster and you may receive a higher benefit amount.

## How to Apply for LIHEAP

### Step 1: Find Your State's LIHEAP Program

Each state runs LIHEAP under its own name and through its own agency. Here's how to find yours:

- **National hotline:** Call **1-866-674-6327** (LIHEAP national referral line)
- **Online directory:** Visit **acf.hhs.gov/ocs/liheap-state-and-territory-contact-listing**
- **211 helpline:** Dial **2-1-1** from any phone for local assistance referrals

Here are the program names in some of the largest states:

| State | Program Name | Where to Apply |
|---|---|---|
| California | LIHEAP/HEAP | Local Community Action Agency |
| Texas | CEAP (Comprehensive Energy Assistance Program) | Local CEAP provider |
| Florida | LIHEAP | Department of Economic Opportunity / local agency |
| New York | HEAP (Home Energy Assistance Program) | Local Department of Social Services |
| Pennsylvania | LIHEAP | County Assistance Office |
| Illinois | LIHEAP | Local Community Action Agency |
| Ohio | HEAP | Local Community Action Agency |
| Georgia | LIHEAP | Division of Family and Children Services |
| Michigan | Michigan Energy Assistance Program | Department of Health and Human Services |
| Arizona | LIHEAP | Department of Economic Security |

### Step 2: Check Your State's Application Window

Unlike some government programs that accept applications year-round, **LIHEAP operates on a seasonal basis** in most states. Heating assistance applications typically open in the fall (October or November) and close in the spring (March or April). Cooling assistance often has a separate window in the summer months.

**Apply as early as possible.** LIHEAP funds are limited, and many states distribute benefits on a first-come, first-served basis. When the money runs out, the program closes for the season — even if there are still eligible applicants waiting.

### Step 3: Gather Your Documents

Before applying, collect:

- **Proof of identity:** Driver's license, state ID, or other government-issued ID for all adult household members
- **Social Security numbers** for all household members
- **Proof of income:** Pay stubs (last 30 days), tax returns, Social Security award letters, unemployment statements, pension statements. Some states ask for income from the last 30 days; others want annual income
- **Most recent utility bill(s):** Electric, gas, propane, oil, or other heating/cooling bills showing your account number and balance
- **Proof of residency:** Lease agreement, mortgage statement, or utility bill showing your address
- **Proof of household size:** Birth certificates for children, documentation of all people living in the home

### Step 4: Submit Your Application

Depending on your state, you can apply:

- **In person** at your local Community Action Agency, Department of Social Services, or other designated office
- **By mail** using a paper application form
- **Online** (available in some but not all states)
- **By phone** (some states offer phone-based applications)

Many applicants find that applying in person at their local **Community Action Agency** is the most efficient route — staff can help you complete the application, identify missing documents, and connect you with other assistance programs at the same time.

### Step 5: Wait for Processing

Processing times vary by state, but most applications are reviewed within **30 to 60 days**. Crisis assistance applications are typically processed much faster — within **48 hours to 2 weeks** in most states.

Once approved, the benefit is usually paid directly to your utility company or fuel vendor. You'll receive a notice telling you the benefit amount and where the payment was sent.

## What If You Have a Shutoff Notice Right Now?

If you're facing an imminent utility disconnection, don't wait for regular LIHEAP processing. Here's what to do immediately:

### 1. Apply for LIHEAP Crisis Assistance

Call your local LIHEAP office and tell them you have a shutoff notice. Crisis applications are processed on an expedited basis — sometimes within 24–48 hours. Have your shutoff notice and utility bill ready.

### 2. Contact Your Utility Company

Most utility companies have their own hardship programs and payment plans. Call the number on your bill and ask about:

- **Payment arrangements:** Spreading your balance over several months
- **Budget billing:** Averaging your annual costs into equal monthly payments
- **Hardship programs:** Many utilities offer discounts of 15–30% for low-income customers
- **Medical certificates:** If someone in your household depends on electricity for medical equipment, you may be protected from shutoff

### 3. Know Your Shutoff Protections

Most states have laws protecting consumers from utility disconnection:

- **Winter moratoriums:** Many states prohibit gas and electric shutoffs during the coldest months (typically November through March)
- **Extreme heat protections:** Some states prohibit shutoffs during excessive heat warnings
- **Medical protections:** Households with medically vulnerable members can often get temporary shutoff protection with a doctor's note
- **Elderly and disabled protections:** Many states have additional protections for households with elderly or disabled members
- **Weekends and holidays:** Most states prohibit shutoffs on Fridays, weekends, and holidays

### 4. Dial 211

The national 211 helpline connects you with local emergency assistance resources, including organizations that can help with urgent utility bills when LIHEAP isn't enough or isn't available.

## Other Energy Assistance Programs Beyond LIHEAP

LIHEAP is the biggest energy assistance program, but it's far from the only one. If LIHEAP doesn't cover enough of your bill — or if you're over the income limit — explore these alternatives:

### Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)

The Department of Energy's WAP helps low-income households reduce energy costs by improving the energy efficiency of their homes. Services include:

- Insulation (attic, walls, floors)
- Air sealing (caulking, weather stripping)
- Heating and cooling system repair or replacement
- Water heater insulation or replacement
- Energy-efficient window and door upgrades
- Safety inspections

WAP services are free and can reduce your energy bills by an average of **$283 per year**. Income eligibility is generally 200% of FPL. Apply through your local Community Action Agency.

### Utility Company Programs

Almost every major utility company offers some form of low-income assistance:

- **Duke Energy:** Share the Light Fund, Energy Neighbor Fund
- **Florida Power & Light:** Care to Share program
- **PG&E (California):** California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) — 20% or more discount
- **Con Edison (New York):** Low-income rate discounts
- **Dominion Energy:** EnergyShare program

Call your utility company and ask what programs they offer. Many go underutilized because customers don't know to ask.

### State and Local Programs

Many states run their own energy assistance programs in addition to LIHEAP:

- **California:** CARE (California Alternate Rates for Energy) provides a 30–35% discount on gas and electric bills
- **New York:** Regular Arrears Supplement (RAS) helps with past-due balances
- **Texas:** Lite-Up Texas offers discounted electricity rates
- **Ohio:** PIPP Plus (Percentage of Income Payment Plan) caps your energy bill at a percentage of your income
- **Illinois:** Percentage of Income Payment Plan (PIPP) limits heating bills to 6% of income

### Nonprofit and Charitable Organizations

Several nonprofits help with energy bills:

- **Salvation Army:** Offers emergency utility assistance in most communities
- **St. Vincent de Paul Society:** Provides emergency bill payment help
- **Catholic Charities:** Utility assistance programs in many areas
- **Modest Needs:** Self-sufficiency grants for working families just above the poverty line
- **Local churches and community organizations:** Many have emergency funds for utility bills

### Federal Tax Credits for Energy Efficiency

If you own your home, you may qualify for federal tax credits that reduce the cost of energy-efficient upgrades:

- **Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit:** Up to $3,200/year for qualifying improvements like heat pumps, insulation, windows, and doors
- **Residential Clean Energy Credit:** 30% credit for solar panels, solar water heaters, geothermal heat pumps, and battery storage systems

These credits reduce your tax bill dollar-for-dollar and can dramatically cut your long-term energy costs.

## Tips to Lower Your Energy Bills

While you're getting help with current bills, take steps to reduce future costs:

### Quick Wins (No Cost)

- **Adjust your thermostat:** Each degree you lower in winter (or raise in summer) saves roughly 3% on your heating/cooling bill
- **Use ceiling fans:** Fans use far less electricity than AC. In summer, set fans counterclockwise; in winter, set them clockwise on low
- **Seal drafts:** Use rolled towels or draft stoppers at the base of exterior doors
- **Unplug unused electronics:** "Phantom" energy use from plugged-in devices can add $100–$200/year to your bill
- **Wash clothes in cold water:** Heating water accounts for about 90% of the energy your washing machine uses
- **Air-dry dishes:** Skip the heated dry cycle on your dishwasher
- **Close curtains strategically:** In summer, close curtains on sun-facing windows. In winter, open them to let solar heat in during the day

### Low-Cost Improvements ($10–$100)

- **LED light bulbs:** Replace incandescent bulbs with LEDs — they use 75% less energy and last 25 times longer
- **Smart power strips:** Automatically cut power to devices in standby mode
- **Programmable thermostat:** Set your HVAC to reduce heating/cooling when you're asleep or away
- **Weatherstripping:** Seal gaps around windows and doors for $5–$10 per opening
- **Water heater blanket:** Insulating your water heater tank can save $20–$45/year
- **Faucet aerators and low-flow showerheads:** Reduce hot water usage without sacrificing comfort

### Bigger Investments (Consider WAP or Tax Credits)

- **Attic insulation:** One of the highest-ROI energy improvements
- **Energy-efficient windows:** Can reduce heat loss by 25–30%
- **Heat pump systems:** Modern heat pumps can heat and cool your home at 2–3 times the efficiency of traditional systems
- **Solar panels:** With the 30% federal tax credit and state incentives, solar is more affordable than ever

## Frequently Asked Questions About LIHEAP

### Do I have to own my home to qualify for LIHEAP?

No. Renters are eligible for LIHEAP as long as they pay energy costs — either directly to a utility company or as part of their rent. If utilities are included in your rent, you can still apply; the benefit may be issued to you directly.

### Can I apply for LIHEAP if I've received it before?

Yes. You can apply every year during your state's open application period. You need to reapply each season — benefits do not automatically renew.

### Will LIHEAP pay my entire electric bill?

Typically no. LIHEAP is designed to supplement your energy costs, not cover them entirely. However, the benefit can make a significant difference — especially when combined with other programs and energy-saving strategies.

### How long does it take to get LIHEAP benefits?

Regular applications are usually processed within 30 to 60 days. Crisis or emergency applications can be processed within 48 hours to 2 weeks. Benefits are paid directly to your utility company or fuel vendor in most cases.

### What if my LIHEAP application is denied?

You have the right to appeal. Your denial notice will include instructions for requesting a fair hearing. Common reasons for denial include income over the limit, missing documentation, or applying outside the program period. Address the issue cited and consider reapplying.

### Does receiving LIHEAP affect my other benefits?

No. LIHEAP benefits are not counted as income for determining eligibility for SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, TANF, or most other federal programs. Receiving LIHEAP will not reduce your other benefits.

### Can undocumented immigrants receive LIHEAP?

LIHEAP eligibility generally requires U.S. citizenship or qualified immigration status. However, eligible household members can apply on behalf of the household, and some states have specific provisions. Check your state's rules.

## Don't Wait Until You're in Crisis

Energy costs aren't going down, and there's no reason to struggle in silence when help is available. If you're spending more than 6% of your household income on energy — what's known as a high energy burden — you should look into LIHEAP and every other assistance program mentioned in this guide.

The most important step is the first one: **apply**. Call **1-866-674-6327** to find your local LIHEAP office, or dial **2-1-1** for immediate help. If your state's application window hasn't opened yet, mark the opening date on your calendar and apply on day one — funds go fast, and early applicants are most likely to receive full benefits.

Your family deserves to live in a home that's warm in winter and cool in summer. These programs exist to make that possible.
