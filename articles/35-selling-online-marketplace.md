Somewhere in your house right now, there are items worth hundreds — maybe thousands — of dollars sitting in closets, garages, and storage bins collecting dust. And once you sell those, you can learn to source more inventory for pennies on the dollar and flip it for serious profit.

Selling on eBay and Facebook Marketplace isn't just for people cleaning out their junk drawer. It's a legitimate income stream that thousands of Americans use to earn **$1,000-$5,000+ per month** — some as a side hustle, others as a full-time business. The barriers to entry are practically zero. You need a phone, an internet connection, and a willingness to learn.

This guide covers everything: which platform to use and when, what items sell best, how to price for profit, taking photos that actually get clicks, shipping without losing money, avoiding scams, and scaling from casual seller to consistent earner. Whether you've never sold anything online or you've dabbled and want to level up, this is your playbook.

## eBay vs. Facebook Marketplace: Which Should You Use?

Both platforms have millions of buyers. The right one depends on what you're selling.

### eBay: Best For...

- **Items that ship easily** — small, lightweight, high-value items
- **Collectibles and specialty items** — buyers search eBay nationally (and internationally) for specific things
- **Used electronics** — phones, laptops, gaming consoles, cameras
- **Brand-name clothing and shoes** — especially vintage, designer, and athletic brands
- **Parts and accessories** — auto parts, phone cases, printer cartridges, replacement components
- **Items worth $20+** — eBay's fees make very cheap items less profitable

**eBay advantages:**
- Access to **132 million active buyers** worldwide
- Built-in shipping tools and discounted shipping rates
- Buyer/seller protection programs
- "Sold" listings data lets you research exactly what things sell for
- Auction format can drive prices up for rare items

**eBay fees:** 13.25% final value fee on most categories (includes payment processing), plus $0.30 per order. You get 250 free listings per month; additional listings cost $0.35 each.

### Facebook Marketplace: Best For...

- **Large, heavy, or bulky items** — furniture, appliances, exercise equipment
- **Local pickup items** — anything that's expensive or impractical to ship
- **Vehicles, trailers, and outdoor equipment**
- **Home goods and decor**
- **Baby items and kids' stuff** — local parents love Marketplace deals
- **Quick sales** — things that sell within hours to days, not weeks

**Facebook Marketplace advantages:**
- **No selling fees** for local pickup transactions
- Shipping option available (fees apply: 5% or $0.40 minimum)
- Massive local audience — millions of people check Marketplace daily
- No listing limits
- Instant messaging with buyers
- Free and easy to use

**Facebook Marketplace drawbacks:**
- Flaky buyers (no-shows are common)
- Less buyer/seller protection than eBay
- Lowball offers are rampant
- No "sold" data to research pricing

### The Smart Strategy: Use Both

Top sellers use both platforms strategically:
- List **shippable, specialty items** on eBay for maximum reach
- List **large items and things you want to sell fast** on Facebook Marketplace for local buyers
- Cross-post items to both when it makes sense — just remember to remove one listing when it sells on the other

## Where to Find Inventory (Sourcing)

Once you've sold the items in your own home, you need to find more. Here's where experienced resellers source their inventory.

### Thrift Stores

**Goodwill, Salvation Army, Savers, and local thrift shops** are the bread and butter of reselling.

- **What to look for:** Brand-name clothing, vintage items, electronics that work, quality kitchenware, books (textbooks especially), and anything that looks out of place (a $200 jacket in a $5 thrift store happens more often than you'd think)
- **Best times to go:** Tuesday-Thursday mornings when new stock hits the floor and the weekend crowds haven't picked through it
- **Budget tip:** Many thrift stores have color-tag sales (50% off certain color tags) and regular discount days

### Garage and Estate Sales

Estate sales are particularly lucrative because you often find quality items from an entire household priced to sell quickly.

- **How to find them:** [EstateSales.net](https://www.estatesales.net), [GarageSalesFinder.com](https://www.garagesalesfinder.com), Craigslist, and Facebook groups
- **Strategy:** Go early for the best selection, or go late on the last day for the biggest discounts (many sales do 50% off on the final day)
- **What to buy:** Electronics, tools, vintage items, jewelry, brand-name clothing, sporting goods, and anything in its original packaging

### Retail Clearance (Retail Arbitrage)

Stores mark items down drastically to clear inventory. These discounted items can be resold at full market value online.

- **Best stores:** Walmart (clearance endcaps), Target (especially end-of-season), Home Depot, Lowe's, CVS, and Walgreens
- **What to buy:** Seasonal items on clearance, discontinued products, and items marked 50-75% off
- **Tools:** Use the **eBay app** to scan barcodes and instantly see what items sell for online. If the clearance price is less than 50% of the eBay selling price, it's usually worth buying.

### Online Arbitrage

Buy discounted items from one online store and resell on eBay.

- **Where to look:** Amazon Warehouse Deals, Woot, SlickDeals, Brickseek (for local store clearance inventory)
- **Caution:** Factor in all costs (purchase price + shipping to you + eBay fees + shipping to buyer) before buying. Margins can be thin.

### Free Items

People give away valuable things every single day.

- **Facebook Marketplace "Free" section** — furniture, electronics, appliances, building materials
- **Craigslist "Free" section**
- **Curbside finds** — especially on trash/bulk pickup days in upscale neighborhoods
- **Buy Nothing Groups** on Facebook — community groups where people give things away

**The mindset:** One person's unwanted treadmill is your $300 Facebook Marketplace sale. One person's "free old dresser" is your $150 flip after a $10 can of chalk paint.

## Pricing Strategy: How to Price for Maximum Profit

Pricing too high means your items sit. Pricing too low means you leave money on the table. Here's how to find the sweet spot.

### eBay Pricing

**Step 1: Research completed sales.**
1. Search for your item on eBay
2. Click "Advanced" next to the search bar
3. Check "Sold Items" and "Completed Items"
4. Filter by condition (used, new, refurbished)
5. Look at the last 30-90 days of sales

This tells you exactly what buyers have actually paid — not what sellers are asking (which is often wishful thinking).

**Step 2: Price competitively.**
- For items with lots of recent sales data, price at or slightly below the average sold price for a quicker sale
- For rare items with few comparables, price higher and be patient
- Use "Buy It Now" with "Best Offer" enabled for flexibility

**Step 3: Factor in all costs.**
- eBay's fee: ~13.25% of the total (item price + shipping charged to buyer)
- Shipping cost (if you offer free shipping, build it into the price)
- Cost of goods (what you paid for the item)
- Packaging materials ($0.50-$2.00 per item)

**Pricing formula:**
Target selling price = (Cost of goods + Shipping cost + Packaging) / (1 - 0.1325) + Desired profit

**Example:** You bought a jacket for $5, shipping will cost $8, packaging is $1. Your total cost is $14. To make $20 profit: sell for at least $40 ($14 cost + $20 profit = $34, divided by 0.8675 to cover fees = ~$39.19, round up to $40).

### Facebook Marketplace Pricing

Marketplace is simpler because there are no fees for local sales.

- **Check competition:** Search for similar items on Marketplace to see what others are asking
- **Price 15-20% higher than your bottom line** — buyers will negotiate, so build in room
- **Use round numbers** — $50, $75, $100 — they feel cleaner and sell faster
- **Mark items as "firm" or "OBO" (or best offer)** in the description to set expectations

**Pro tip:** If something isn't getting views or messages after 3-5 days, the price is too high. Drop it 10-15% and relist.

## Photos That Sell: How to Take Listings From Ignored to Irresistible

Your photos are the single most important factor in whether someone clicks your listing or scrolls past it. Professional-looking photos don't require professional equipment.

### The Basics

- **Use natural light.** Photograph near a window during the day. Avoid flash — it creates harsh shadows and washes out colors.
- **Use a clean, uncluttered background.** A white sheet, a clean wall, or a simple backdrop. Buyers focus on the item, not your messy kitchen counter.
- **Take multiple angles.** Front, back, sides, top, bottom, close-ups of details, labels, and any flaws.
- **Show scale.** For small items, include something for size reference. For clothing, photograph it on a hanger or laid flat.
- **Be honest about flaws.** Photograph scratches, stains, missing parts, or wear. This builds trust and reduces returns.

### Photo Checklist for Every Listing

1. Main photo: item centered, clean background, good lighting
2. Brand/label close-up (especially for clothing and electronics)
3. Size or model number detail
4. Any accessories included
5. Close-up of condition (any wear, damage, or defects)
6. In-use or styled photo (shows buyer how the item looks in real life)

### Platform-Specific Tips

**eBay:**
- Use a 1:1 (square) aspect ratio
- First photo should be on a white or very light background
- Upload at least 5-8 photos per listing (eBay allows up to 24 for free)
- Add stock photos or catalog images if available (but always include your own real photos too)

**Facebook Marketplace:**
- First photo matters most — it's the thumbnail in search results
- Lifestyle photos work well (a piece of furniture in a styled room sells better than furniture against a bare wall)
- Include a photo of the item next to something for scale
- Upload at least 4-6 photos

**Pro tip:** Spend the most time on your first photo. That one image determines whether someone clicks or keeps scrolling. Make it clean, bright, and focused.

## Writing Descriptions That Convert

A good description answers every question a buyer might have — so they can buy with confidence instead of moving to the next listing.

### What Every Description Needs

1. **Item name with key details** — Brand, model, size, color
2. **Condition** — Be specific. "Good condition" is vague. "Light scuff on the left toe, no other visible wear" is helpful.
3. **Measurements or specifications** — Dimensions for furniture and decor, size measurements for clothing (not just "Large"), specs for electronics
4. **What's included** — List everything in the box or bundle
5. **What's NOT included** — Prevents returns and disputes
6. **Keywords** — Include words buyers actually search for

### eBay Description Template

```
[Brand Name] [Item Name] - [Key Feature/Size/Color]

Condition: [Specific, honest description of condition]

Specifications:
- [Dimension/size/capacity]
- [Model number]
- [Color/material]

What's included:
- [Item list]

What's NOT included:
- [Anything missing or not shown]

Notes:
- [Any additional details - tested and working, freshly cleaned, etc.]

Ships within [1-2] business days via [USPS/UPS/FedEx].
```

### Facebook Marketplace Description Template

```
[Item Name] — [Brand] — [Key Details]

Asking $[Price] (firm / OBO)

[2-3 sentences about the item, condition, and why it's a good deal]

Measurements: [if applicable]
Works perfectly / Great condition / [honest condition note]

Pick up in [your general area — neighborhood or cross streets, not your exact address]

Cash, Venmo, or Zelle accepted.
No trades. No delivery. Serious buyers only.
```

### SEO Keywords for Listings

Think about what a buyer would search. Include these in your title and description:
- Brand name
- Model name or number
- Size (dimensions, clothing size)
- Color
- Condition keywords ("like new," "vintage," "refurbished")
- Use case ("gaming laptop," "work boots," "nursery dresser")

**Pro tip:** On eBay, the title is your most important SEO tool. You get 80 characters — use every one of them with relevant keywords. Don't waste characters on "WOW!" or "L@@K" — nobody searches for those.

## Shipping: How to Ship Without Losing Your Profit

Shipping is where many new sellers lose money. Understanding your options and pricing shipping correctly protects your margins.

### Shipping Options and When to Use Them

**USPS (United States Postal Service):**
- Best for items under 1 lb (First Class Mail: $3.50-$5.00)
- Best for items 1-5 lbs (Priority Mail: $8-$15)
- Flat Rate boxes are great for heavy, small items (Small Flat Rate: ~$10, Medium: ~$16, Large: ~$22)
- Free boxes and envelopes for Priority Mail (order at [usps.com/freeboxes](https://www.usps.com/ship/free-supplies.htm))

**UPS:**
- Best for items 5-20 lbs
- Often cheaper than USPS for heavier packages
- eBay offers discounted UPS rates through their shipping tools

**FedEx:**
- Similar to UPS for heavier items
- FedEx SmartPost can be cheap for lighter packages
- eBay offers discounted FedEx rates as well

**Pirate Ship ([pirateship.com](https://www.pirateship.com)):**
- Free shipping platform that offers USPS Commercial Plus rates and UPS discounts
- Often cheaper than buying postage directly
- Works for both eBay and independent sales

### Free Shipping vs. Calculated Shipping

**Free shipping** listings get more visibility on eBay (the algorithm favors them) and more clicks from buyers. But you're paying for shipping out of your sale price.

- **For items under 1 lb:** Offer free shipping and build $4-$5 into your price
- **For items 1-5 lbs:** Offer free shipping and build $10-$15 into your price
- **For heavy items (5+ lbs):** Use calculated shipping — let eBay calculate the exact cost based on the buyer's location. Buyers understand that heavy items cost more to ship.

### Packaging Tips

- **Recycle packaging.** Save Amazon boxes, bubble wrap, and packing materials. Free supplies are everywhere.
- **Use USPS free boxes** for Priority Mail shipments (don't use them for non-Priority shipments — that's against the rules and will result in postage due)
- **Weigh items before listing.** A cheap kitchen scale ($10-$15 on Amazon) will save you hundreds in shipping overcharges.
- **Pack securely.** Nothing kills your seller rating faster than items arriving damaged. Use bubble wrap, crumpled paper, or air pillows to prevent movement inside the box.
- **Print labels at home.** This is cheaper than going to the post office, and you can schedule free USPS pickups from your mailbox or porch.

### Facebook Marketplace Shipping

If you enable shipping on Facebook Marketplace:
- Facebook charges 5% of the sale price (minimum $0.40)
- Prepaid shipping labels are provided
- Buyer pays shipping cost
- Items must be shipped within 3 business days
- Facebook holds payment until buyer confirms receipt or 5 days after delivery

**For local sales (no shipping):** Meet in a public, well-lit location. Many police stations have designated "safe exchange zones" for online sales. Never invite strangers to your home.

## Avoiding Scams: Protect Yourself as a Seller

Both platforms have scammers. Here's how to avoid them.

### Common eBay Scams

**"Item Not Received" fraud:**
- Buyer claims the item never arrived even though it did
- **Protection:** Always use tracked shipping. For items over $750, require signature confirmation. eBay sides with the seller when tracking shows delivery.

**Return fraud:**
- Buyer returns a different (cheaper or broken) item
- **Protection:** Photograph and video the item and serial numbers before shipping. If you receive a different item back, file a police report and open a case with eBay.

**Overpayment scam:**
- Buyer sends more than the asking price and asks you to refund the difference
- **Protection:** eBay handles all payments through their managed payment system. If someone contacts you outside eBay to pay, it's a scam. Always transact through the platform.

### Common Facebook Marketplace Scams

**Fake payment screenshots:**
- Buyer shows a fake Zelle/Venmo confirmation that the money was sent
- **Protection:** Never hand over an item until the money is actually in your account. Confirm in your own app, not their screenshot.

**Overpayment with check:**
- Buyer sends a check for more than the asking price and asks you to send back the difference
- **Protection:** Never accept checks from strangers. Cash, Zelle, Venmo, or PayPal only.

**Bait and switch at meetup:**
- Buyer shows up and claims they only have less than the agreed price
- **Protection:** Confirm the price via message before meeting. If they try to negotiate in person, say no and walk away. You can always sell to someone else.

**Stolen account messages:**
- A hacked Facebook account contacts you with an overly eager, generic message
- **Protection:** Check the buyer's profile. New accounts, no friends, no photos, and no marketplace history are red flags.

### General Safety Rules

1. **Meet in public places** for local sales — parking lots with cameras, police stations, busy retail areas
2. **Bring someone with you** for high-value transactions
3. **Never share personal information** — no home address, bank details, or Social Security number
4. **Trust your gut** — if something feels off, cancel the transaction
5. **Cash is king for local sales** — it's the only payment that can't be reversed
6. **Keep all communication on the platform** — messages are your evidence if there's a dispute

## Scaling Up: From Casual Seller to Consistent Earner

Selling the occasional item from your closet is fine. But if you want to turn this into a real income stream, you need systems.

### Track Your Numbers

You can't improve what you don't measure. Track these metrics:

- **Cost of goods:** What you paid for each item
- **Selling price:** What it sold for
- **Fees:** eBay fees, shipping costs, packaging costs
- **Net profit:** Selling price minus all costs
- **ROI (Return on Investment):** Profit divided by cost of goods. Aim for 100%+ ROI (doubling your money or better)
- **Sell-through rate:** What percentage of your inventory sells within 30 days

Use a simple spreadsheet or an app like **Seller Toolkit** or **Scoutly** to track everything.

### Build Repeatable Sourcing Routines

Consistent income requires consistent inventory. Build a weekly routine:

- **Monday:** Check online clearance deals and arbitrage opportunities
- **Tuesday/Wednesday:** Hit thrift stores (stock is freshest early in the week)
- **Thursday:** List new inventory — photograph, write descriptions, post
- **Friday:** Ship sold items, respond to buyer messages
- **Saturday:** Hit garage sales and estate sales (get the route planned Friday night)
- **Sunday:** Accounting — update your spreadsheet, review what sold and what didn't, adjust prices

### Increase Your Average Selling Price

The easiest way to earn more isn't to sell more items — it's to sell **higher-value** items. Same effort to list and ship a $15 item as a $150 item.

- Graduate from $5-$10 thrift store finds to $50-$200 estate sale and clearance deals
- Learn to identify valuable brands, vintage items, and collectibles
- Specialize in a niche where you can develop expertise (vintage electronics, designer shoes, power tools)

### Reinvest Your Profits

When you're starting out, resist the temptation to spend all your profits. Reinvest a portion back into inventory:

- **Month 1-2:** Reinvest 50-75% of profits into sourcing better inventory
- **Month 3-4:** Scale back to 30-50% reinvestment as your inventory grows
- **Month 5+:** Take out consistent profit while maintaining your inventory level

### Consider an eBay Store

Once you're selling more than 250 items per month, an **eBay Store subscription** makes financial sense:

| Store Level | Monthly Cost | Free Listings | Final Value Fee Discount |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Starter | $7.95 | 250 | Small discount |
| Basic | $27.95 | 1,000 | Moderate discount |
| Premium | $74.95 | 10,000 | Significant discount |
| Anchor | $349.95 | 25,000 | Maximum discount |

The Starter or Basic store pays for itself if you're listing more than 250-300 items monthly through the reduced fees alone.

---

## Tax Considerations for Online Sellers

Online selling income is taxable. Here's what you need to know.

### Reporting Requirements

- **eBay and Facebook** report your sales to the IRS on Form 1099-K if you receive $600 or more in payments during the year
- This doesn't mean you owe taxes on the full $600 — you only owe taxes on your **profit** (selling price minus cost of goods, fees, shipping, and supplies)
- If you sell personal items for less than you originally paid, there's generally no taxable income — but you still need to report the 1099-K and show that you had a loss

### Deductible Expenses

Track and deduct these costs:
- Cost of goods purchased for resale
- eBay and platform fees
- Shipping costs and packaging materials
- Mileage driven for sourcing (thrift stores, estate sales, post office)
- Home office or storage space (portion of rent/mortgage, utilities)
- Phone and internet (business-use percentage)
- Equipment (scale, printer, camera, photo setup)
- Software and subscriptions (listing tools, accounting software)

### Set Aside Money for Taxes

If you're profiting consistently, set aside **25-30%** of your net profit for taxes. Self-employment tax (15.3%) plus your income tax rate adds up.

**Pro tip:** Open a separate bank account for your reselling business. Deposit all sales revenue there, pay all business expenses from there, and transfer profits to your personal account. This makes accounting and taxes dramatically easier.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much money can I realistically make selling on eBay and Facebook Marketplace?

Most casual sellers who spend 5-10 hours per week earn $500-$1,500 per month. Dedicated sellers who treat it like a part-time job (15-25 hours/week) regularly earn $2,000-$5,000 per month. The biggest factors are the quality of your inventory (what you source and how much you pay for it), your pricing strategy, and your consistency. Top resellers earn $10,000+ per month, but that level typically requires significant time, storage space, and capital.

### Do I need a business license to sell on eBay or Facebook Marketplace?

For occasional selling of personal items, no license is needed. However, if you're buying items specifically to resell for profit on a regular basis, most states consider that a business and may require a business license and sales tax collection. Requirements vary by state and city. Check with your state's Department of Revenue and your city or county clerk's office. Many resellers operate as sole proprietors initially and form an LLC once their income becomes significant.

### What should I do if a buyer claims an item wasn't as described?

On eBay, buyers can open an "Item Not As Described" case. If your listing was accurate with clear photos and descriptions of condition, contact the buyer first to try to resolve it. If eBay steps in, they'll review the listing against the complaint. Being detailed and honest in your descriptions is your best protection. On Facebook Marketplace, local cash sales are generally final — but maintaining honest listings protects your reputation and avoids disputes.

### Is it worth selling items under $10?

Generally, no — not on eBay. After fees and shipping, your profit margin on a $10 item is tiny. The exception is lightweight items where you can charge for shipping (books, small accessories, trading cards). On Facebook Marketplace, $10 items can work for local pickup since there are no fees, but consider whether the time to communicate with buyers and arrange pickup is worth it. Your time has value.

### How do I handle returns on eBay?

eBay strongly encourages sellers to accept returns — listings with free returns get better search visibility. Offer at least 30-day returns. For "buyer's remorse" returns (they just changed their mind), the buyer pays return shipping. For "item not as described" returns, you pay return shipping. Keep your return rate low by writing accurate descriptions and photographing every flaw. Most sellers see return rates under 5%.
